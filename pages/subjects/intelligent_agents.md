        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>With Dr. Stelios Sotiriadis as our tutor, the "Intelligent Agents" module introduced students to intelligent agents and its various interconnected applications, such as first-order logic, agent-based modelling, and natural language processing (NLP). It placed an emphasis on uniting the theoretical and practical components of intelligent agent systems while stimulating critical thinking and fostering collaboration, promoting an environment where students had to work together to tackle its diverse activities.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="team-discussions1">Team Project: Initial Discussions</h2>
            <p>Initial contact with my team, Group C, began immediately after the module became available. Guilherme, Mohammad, Haris, and I began planning when we'd meet for our first discussion and how communication would occur (such as through Teams, WhatsApp, or Discord). While time zone differences did ultimately factor in as a challenge, we effectively managed to communicate our schedules and ideas so that we'd remain mindful of all members' available time. Ultimately, we settled on Discord and created a group chat for our discussions, while also using BigBlueButton for our meetings.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="colab-1">Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
            <p>The first collaborative learning discussion served as a way for students to warm up to the module by discussing about agent-based systems. For it, we had the following topic to elaborate on:<br><br>
            
            "<i>Discuss what has led to the rise of agent-based systems and the benefits that this approach can offer to organisations. Discussion should include at least three references."</i><br><br>

            Students were required to create an initial post and, then, address at least 3 of their peers' submissions before creating a summary post. This final entry would serve as an evolved version of a student's initial post, incorporating peer responses and directly addressing them by either agreeing or not and providing the reasons for either case. My initial post, "The Interdisciplinary Role of Agent-Based Systems", was as follows:<br><br>

            <h3 id="colab-11">Peer feedback</h3>
                <p>The peer responses from Abdulhakim Bashir and Georgios Papachristou were instrumental in building upon my initial post. For Abdulhakim, his response was as follows:<br><br>

                <font size="2">Figure 2: Abdulhakim's peer response to my initial post</font></center><br><br>
                
                As for Georgios, his response was:

                <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/georgios_disc1.png" height="500" width="1100"><br>

                <font size="2">Figure 3: Georgios' peer response to my initial post</font></center>
                
                </p><br><br>


            <h3 id="colab-12">Summary post</h3>
                <p>My initial entry was significantly enhanced by my peers' feedback. Their comments were addressed by my summary post, which was as follows:<br><br>

                <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/summary_post_disc1.png" height="550" width="1100"><br>
                
                <font size="2">Figure 4: My summary post in the first discussion forum</font></center></p><br><br>

        
        <h2 id="team-discussions2">Team Project: Formulations, Contract, and Roles</h2>
            <p>The group (minus Haris, who was unable to join) met on February 6th for an initial discussion and to agree on roles and terms for the team contract. Although a fairly quick meeting, it allowed us to have a proper initial contact with each other and brainstorm possible ideas for the project.<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/first_meeting_minutes.png" height="300" width="1000"><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 5: The first meeting minutes of the group, highlighting the topics that were discussed</font></center></p><br><br>


        <h2 id="team-discussions3">Team Project: Report Draft</h2>
            <p>The group progressed very quickly on the assignment and ultimately settled on the "Academic Research Online" theme. We named our approach SAGE (Scalable Academic Goal-driven Explorer) and based it on agentic AI, one of the most modern and powerful applications of agent-based systems. Frequent discussions on Discord led me to produce a draft of the final report, which was evaluated and improved upon by other team members.<br><br>

        <h2 id="team-discussions4">Team Project: Final Adjustments, Submission, and Feedback</h2>
            <p>After discussions on what could be improved, as well as ideas that could be implemented, the team finalised the final version of the report, which now consisted of a comprehensive proposal for a robust agentic AI-based system for online academic research.<br><br>

            Ultimately, Haris submitted the project report almost a week before the deadline. The project itself, the quality of the submission, and the time taken for submission showcase how efficiently the team worked together and leveraged skills such as project and time management, academic writing, and criticality. Our report was well-received by Professor Stelios Sotiriadis, whose feedback was as follows:<br><br>

        <h2 id="unit6-activity">Unit 6 Activity</h2>
            <p>The unit 6 activity consisted of the following:<br><br>

            "<i>Activity Guidance<br><br>
                Create an agent dialogue, using KQML and KIF, between two agents (named Alice and Bob).<br><br>

                Alice is an agent designed to procure stock and Bob is an agent that controls the stock levels for a warehouse. This dialogue should see Alice asking Bob about the available stock of 50 inch televisions, and also querying the number of HDMI slots the televisions have.<br><br>

                Add your completed answers to your e-Portfolio.</i>"<br><br>
                
            Coding the requested interaction in KQML and KIF resulted in the following:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/kqml_activity.png" height="300" width="1100"><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 8: Agent dialogue using KQML and KIF</font></center></p><br><br>


        <h2 id="colab-2">Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h2>
            <p>The second collaborative learning discussion further honed students' argumentative skills. This time, we had to elaborate on the following topic:<br><br>

            <i>"Discussion Topic: Agent Communication Languages<br><br>

            What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of the use of agent communication languages such as KQML? How do they compare with method invocation in Python or Java?"</i><br><br>
            
            The second collaborative discussion followed the same structure as the first discussion, where a student had to submit an initial post, address at least 3 of their peers' entries and then create a summary post that incorporated peer responses submitted in the initial entry. My initial post, "The Dualism Between KQML and Modern Programming Languages", was as follows:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/initial_post_2.png" height="550" width="1200"><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 9: My initial post in the second collaborative learning discussion forum</font></center></p><br><br>    


            <h3 id="colab-22">Summary post</h3>
                <p>Unfortunately, none of my peers responded to my initial post in time for the summary post, rendering it devoid of possible enhancements and response options. My summary post was as follows:<br><br>

                <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/summary_post.png" height="600" width="1200"><br>
                
                <font size="2">Figure 10: My summary post in the second discussion forum</font></center></p><br><br>


        <h2 id="colab-outcome">Learning Outcome: Peer Discussions</h2>
            <p>The collaborative learning discussions allowed me to engage with my peers in informative and respectful discussions regarding the proposed topics, thus contributing to my growth in two very important aspects:<br><br><br>
            
            a) <b>Critical thinking:</b> The topics were, by nature, geared towards instigating students to work on identifying and addressing their positive and negative aspects. By the time that we had to take part in the second discussion forum, I was much more proficient at thinking critically and this skill only improved by the end of the second collaborative learning discussion;<br><br>
            
            b) <b>Collaboration:</b> I interacted with several students' posts and directly addressed the content present in them. Not only did I agree or disagree as required but I also provided further material that could be of interest to my peers, such as articles and papers, thus collaborating with them in broadening our perspective of a given topic.<br><br>
            
            </p><br><br>


        <h2 id="#reflective-piece1">Mid-Module Reflective Piece</h2>
            <p>The module progressively introduced more advanced concepts, rapidly transitioning from an introduction to agent-based modelling to a comprehensive overview of symbolic methods. This structured progression ensured students developed a strong conceptual foundation before engaging with complex methodologies, such as logic-based agent reasoning and communication protocols like KQML and KIF. By balancing theoretical discussions with practical implementations, the module provided a holistic understanding of intelligent agents and their applications.<br><br>

            Notably, the group project was a key aspect of this learning experience. Collaborating on SAGE, an agentic AI-driven academic search system, strengthened our critical thinking and teamwork. We navigated challenges such as time zone differences, technical integration, and role allocation, ensuring effective communication and collaboration. This experience not only refined my ability to work in multidisciplinary teams but also highlighted the practical value of agent-based AI solutions in real-world problem-solving.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="unit8-activity">Unit 8 Activity</h2>
            <p>The unit 8 activity consisted of the following:<br><br>

            "<i>Activity Guidance<br><br>
                Create a constituency-based parse tree for the following phrases:<br><br>

                The government raised interest rates.<br>
                The internet gives everyone a voice.<br>
                The man saw the dog with the telescope.<br><br>

                Add your completed answers to your e-Portfolio.</i>"<br><br>
                
            For the first scenario, the phrase can be converted into a fairly simple resulting constituency-based parse tree, which results in the following:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/first_parse_tree.png" height="250" width="400"><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 11: The first constituency-based parse tree</font></center></p><br><br>

            For the second scenario, the phrase results in a slightly more complex parse tree due to the presence of "everyone", a personal pronoun (PRP) that needs to be addressed. This results in the following:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/second_parse_tree.png" height="300" width="400"><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 12: The second constituency-based parse tree</font></center></p><br><br>

            For the third scenario, the phrase's ambiguity results in two possible interpretations: that the man saw the dog by using his telescope, or that the man saw the dog in possession of the telescope. As such, this results in two possible constituency-based parse trees, the first possibility which is as follows:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/third_parse_tree_first_variation.png" height="350" width="400"><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 13: The first variation of the third constituency-based parse tree</font></center></p><br><br>

            For the second possibility, we have the following parse tree:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/third_parse_tree_second_variation.png" height="350" width="400"><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 14: The second variation of the third constituency-based parse tree</font></center></p><br><br>


        <h2 id="colab-3">Collaborative Learning Discussion 3</h2>
            <p>The third collaborative learning discussion served as the culmination of students' earlier engagements. For it, we had the following topic to elaborate on:<br><br>
            
            "<i>The advent of new technologies supported by Deep Learning models mean that it is now possible to generate ‘new’ content, for example, Dall-E AI to generate images or ChatGPT to create prose.<br><br>

            Do you think that these new technologies offer any ethical issues that should be considered, and if not, why not?"</i><br><br>

            Students were required to create an initial post and, then, address at least 3 of their peers' submissions before creating a summary post. This final entry would serve as an evolved version of a student's initial post, incorporating peer responses and directly addressing them by either agreeing or not and providing the reasons for either case. My initial post, "Deep Learning and Ethics: An Ongoing Struggle", was as follows:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/initial_post_3.png" height="600" width="1200"><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 15: My initial post in the third collaborative learning discussion forum</font></center></p><br><br>

            
            <h3 id="colab-31">Peer feedback</h3>
                <p>The peer responses from Georgios Papachristou and Haris Rancevas were instrumental in building upon my initial post. For Georgios, his response was as follows:<br><br>
                
                <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/georgios_disc3.png" height="500" width="1100"><br>

                </p><br><br>


            <h3 id="colab-32">Summary post</h3>
                <p>My initial entry was significantly enhanced by my peers' feedback. Their comments were addressed by my summary post, which was as follows:<br><br>

                <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/summary_post_disc3.png" height="550" width="1100"><br>
                
                <font size="2">Figure 18: My summary post in the third discussion forum</font></center></p><br><br>


        <h2 id="assess2">Final Assessment: Development Individual Project: Presentation</h2>
            <p>The final assignment was a direct continuation of the previous, group-focused one. This time, we had to implement the solution we proposed in unit 6, complemented by a presentation that clearly detailed its relevance. Instead of reusing what I had built with my peers in the group assignment, I decided to restructure the project by emphasising explainability: thus, the Scalable Academic Goal-driven Explorer (SAGE) system was redone using symbolic methods instead of agentic AI, trading raw processing power for simplicity and accountability.<br><br>

            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/symbolic_sage_diagram.png" height="400" width="1000"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 19: A diagram representing SAGE's overall functionalities in its symbolic form</font></center><br><br>

            Additionally, SAGE was further enhanced via a Streamlit-based user interface. This allows users to interact with the system from a webpage, see results being fetched in real time and, should they desire it, clear the database entirely and start anew with fresh academic records.<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/sage_interface.png" height="500" width="1000"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 20: SAGE's Streamlit-based user interface</font></center><br><br>

            The final project allowed us to apply everything we had learned during the module into a concrete solution, which not only had to emphasise its agent-based nature but also be a useful system in its own right. I believe that SAGE could very well stand on its own as an academic-driven solution, one that would allow researchers to delegate some of the time they use to search for academic references to a tool that can do it automatically.

            </p><br><br>
                

            <h3 id="assess2-feedback"><br>Tutor feedback</h3>
                <p>Dr. Stelios Sotiriadis' feedback showed that SAGE had become a very robust system, excelling at what it was meant to do while offering a simplistic interface, while also offering me several areas of improvement, all of which would undoubtedly make SAGE an even more powerful and flexible system. His feedback was as follows:<br><br>
                
                <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/tutor_response.png" height="500" width="1000"><br>

        <h2 id="reflection">Final Reflective Piece</h2>
            <p>The “Intelligent Agents” module has been a major milestone in my academic and technical growth. It offered a balanced combination of theory and application, encouraging not just passive understanding but active problem-solving. Transitioning from group collaboration to an individual development project gave me the freedom to rethink and redesign our original idea in a way that aligned with my interests, especially in explainability and modularity.<br><br>
            
            Redesigning SAGE using symbolic methods rather than agentic AI was a deliberate choice. It allowed me to focus on transparency and traceability over sheer complexity. Through this, I gained valuable experience in modular architecture, object-oriented design, and data validation. Integrating FastAPI and Streamlit also introduced me to practical tools that enhanced both the functionality and usability of the system. The inclusion of a testing suite further solidified my understanding of reliable, maintainable software development.<br><br>

            Beyond the technical aspects, the collaborative discussions throughout the module were instrumental in developing my critical thinking and communication skills. Engaging with peers, offering feedback, and refining my own ideas based on their input was both humbling and enriching. Overall, this module has strengthened my ability to build intelligent systems that are thoughtful, explainable, and grounded in real-world needs.</p>
