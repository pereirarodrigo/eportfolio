        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>With Dr. Stelios Sotiriadis as our tutor, the "Intelligent Agents" module introduced students to intelligent agents and its various interconnected applications, such as first-order logic, agent-based modelling, and natural language processing (NLP). It placed an emphasis on uniting the theoretical and practical components of intelligent agent systems while stimulating critical thinking and fostering collaboration, promoting an environment where students had to work together to tackle its diverse activities.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="team-discussions1">Team Project: Initial Discussions</h2>
            <p>Initial contact with my team, Group C, began immediately after the module became available. Guilherme, Mohammad, Haris, and I began planning when we'd meet for our first discussion and how communication would occur (such as through Teams, WhatsApp, or Discord). While time zone differences did ultimately factor in as a challenge, we effectively managed to communicate our schedules and ideas so that we'd remain mindful of all members' available time. Ultimately, we settled on Discord and created a group chat for our discussions, while also using BigBlueButton for our meetings.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="colab-1">Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
            <p>The first collaborative learning discussion served as a way for students to warm up to the module by discussing about agent-based systems. For it, we had the following topic to elaborate on:<br><br>
            
            "<i>Discuss what has led to the rise of agent-based systems and the benefits that this approach can offer to organisations. Discussion should include at least three references."</i><br><br>

            Students were required to create an initial post and, then, address at least 3 of their peers' submissions before creating a summary post. This final entry would serve as an evolved version of a student's initial post, incorporating peer responses and directly addressing them by either agreeing or not and providing the reasons for either case. My initial post, "The Interdisciplinary Role of Agent-Based Systems", was as follows:<br><br>

            <h3 id="colab-11">Peer feedback</h3>
                <p>The peer responses from Abdulhakim Bashir and Georgios Papachristou were instrumental in building upon my initial post. For Abdulhakim, his response was as follows:<br><br>

                As for Georgios, his response was:

                </p><br><br>


            <h3 id="colab-12">Summary post</h3>
                <p>My initial entry was significantly enhanced by my peers' feedback. Their comments were addressed by my summary post, which was as follows:<br><br>

                <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/summary_post_disc1.png" height="550" width="1100"><br>

        <h2 id="team-discussions2">Team Project: Formulations, Contract, and Roles</h2>
            <p>The group (minus Haris, who was unable to join) met on February 6th for an initial discussion and to agree on roles and terms for the team contract. Although a fairly quick meeting, it allowed us to have a proper initial contact with each other and brainstorm possible ideas for the project.<br><br>

        <h2 id="team-discussions3">Team Project: Report Draft</h2>
            <p>The group progressed very quickly on the assignment and ultimately settled on the "Academic Research Online" theme. We named our approach SAGE (Scalable Academic Goal-driven Explorer) and based it on agentic AI, one of the most modern and powerful applications of agent-based systems. Frequent discussions on Discord led me to produce a draft of the final report, which was evaluated and improved upon by other team members.<br><br>

        <h2 id="team-discussions4">Team Project: Final Adjustments, Submission, and Feedback</h2>
            <p>After discussions on what could be improved, as well as ideas that could be implemented, the team finalised the final version of the report, which now consisted of a comprehensive proposal for a robust agentic AI-based system for online academic research.<br><br>

            Ultimately, Haris submitted the project report almost a week before the deadline. The project itself, the quality of the submission, and the time taken for submission showcase how efficiently the team worked together and leveraged skills such as project and time management, academic writing, and criticality. Our report was well-received by Professor Stelios, whose feedback was as follows:<br><br>

        <h2 id="unit6-activity">Unit 6 Activity</h2>
            <p>The unit 6 activity consisted of the following:<br><br>

            "<i>Activity Guidance<br><br>
                Create an agent dialogue, using KQML and KIF, between two agents (named Alice and Bob).<br><br>

                Alice is an agent designed to procure stock and Bob is an agent that controls the stock levels for a warehouse. This dialogue should see Alice asking Bob about the available stock of 50 inch televisions, and also querying the number of HDMI slots the televisions have.<br><br>

                Add your completed answers to your e-Portfolio.</i>"<br><br>
                
            Coding the requested interaction in KQML and KIF resulted in the following:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/kqml_activity.png" height="300" width="1000"><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 8: Agent dialogue using KQML and KIF</font></center></p><br><br>


        <h2 id="colab-2">Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h2>
            <p>The second collaborative learning discussion further honed students' argumentative skills. This time, we had to elaborate on the following topic:<br><br>

            <i>"Discussion Topic: Agent Communication Languages<br><br>

            What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of the use of agent communication languages such as KQML? How do they compare with method invocation in Python or Java?"</i><br><br>
            
            The second collaborative discussion followed the same structure as the first discussion, where a student had to submit an initial post, address at least 3 of their peers' entries and then create a summary post that incorporated peer responses submitted in the initial entry. My initial post, "The Dualism Between KQML and Modern Programming Languages", was as follows:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/initial_post_2.png" height="550" width="1200"><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 9: My initial post in the second collaborative learning discussion forum</font></center></p><br><br>    


            <h3 id="colab-22">Summary post</h3>
                <p>Unfortunately, none of my peers responded to my initial post in time for the summary post, rendering it devoid of possible enhancements and response options. My summary post was as follows:<br><br>

                <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/summary_post.png" height="600" width="1200"><br>
                
                <font size="2">Figure 10: My summary post in the second discussion forum</font></center></p><br><br>


        <h2 id="colab-outcome">Learning Outcome: Peer Discussions</h2>
            <p>The collaborative learning discussions allowed me to engage with my peers in informative and respectful discussions regarding the proposed topics, thus contributing to my growth in two very important aspects:<br><br><br>
            
            a) <b>Critical thinking:</b> The topics were, by nature, geared towards instigating students to work on identifying and addressing their positive and negative aspects. By the time that we had to take part in the second discussion forum, I was much more proficient at thinking critically and this skill only improved by the end of the second collaborative learning discussion;<br><br>
            
            b) <b>Collaboration:</b> I interacted with several students' posts and directly addressed the content present in them. Not only did I agree or disagree as required but I also provided further material that could be of interest to my peers, such as articles and papers, thus collaborating with them in broadening our perspective of a given topic.<br><br>
            
            </p><br><br>


        <h2 id="#reflective-piece1">Mid-Module Reflective Piece</h2>
            <p>The module progressively introduced more advanced concepts, rapidly transitioning from an introduction to agent-based modelling to a comprehensive overview of symbolic methods. This structured progression ensured students developed a strong conceptual foundation before engaging with complex methodologies, such as logic-based agent reasoning and communication protocols like KQML and KIF. By balancing theoretical discussions with practical implementations, the module provided a holistic understanding of intelligent agents and their applications.<br><br>

            Notably, the group project was a key aspect of this learning experience. Collaborating on SAGE, an agentic AI-driven academic search system, strengthened our critical thinking and teamwork. We navigated challenges such as time zone differences, technical integration, and role allocation, ensuring effective communication and collaboration. This experience not only refined my ability to work in multidisciplinary teams but also highlighted the practical value of agent-based AI solutions in real-world problem-solving.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="unit8-activity">Unit 8 Activity</h2>
            <p>The unit 8 activity consisted of the following:<br><br>

            "<i>Activity Guidance<br><br>
                Create a constituency-based parse tree for the following phrases:<br><br>

                The government raised interest rates.<br>
                The internet gives everyone a voice.<br>
                The man saw the dog with the telescope.<br><br>

                Add your completed answers to your e-Portfolio.</i>"<br><br>
                
            For the first scenario, the phrase can be converted into a fairly simple resulting constituency-based parse tree, which results in the following:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/first_parse_tree.png" height="250" width="400"><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 11: The first constituency-based parse tree</font></center></p><br><br>

            For the second scenario, the phrase results in a slightly more complex parse tree due to the presence of "everyone", a personal pronoun (PRP) that needs to be addressed. This results in the following:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/second_parse_tree.png" height="300" width="400"><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 12: The second constituency-based parse tree</font></center></p><br><br>

            For the third scenario, the phrase's ambiguity results in two possible interpretations: that the man saw the dog by using his telescope, or that the man saw the dog in possession of the telescope. As such, this results in two possible constituency-based parse trees, the first possibility which is as follows:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/third_parse_tree_first_variation.png" height="350" width="400"><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 13: The first variation of the third constituency-based parse tree</font></center></p><br><br>

            For the second possibility, we have the following parse tree:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/intelligent_agents/third_parse_tree_second_variation.png" height="350" width="400"><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 14: The second variation of the third constituency-based parse tree</font></center></p><br><br>


        <h2 id="colab-3">Collaborative Learning Discussion 3</h2>
            <p>The third collaborative learning discussion served as the culmination of students' earlier engagements. For it, we had the following topic to elaborate on:<br><br>
            
            "<i>The advent of new technologies supported by Deep Learning models mean that it is now possible to generate ‘new’ content, for example, Dall-E AI to generate images or ChatGPT to create prose.<br><br>

            Do you think that these new technologies offer any ethical issues that should be considered, and if not, why not?"</i><br><br>

            Students were required to create an initial post and, then, address at least 3 of their peers' submissions before creating a summary post. This final entry would serve as an evolved version of a student's initial post, incorporating peer responses and directly addressing them by either agreeing or not and providing the reasons for either case. My initial post, "Deep Learning and Ethics: An Ongoing Struggle", was as follows:<br><br>

            <h3 id="colab-31">Peer feedback</h3>
                <p>The peer responses from Abdulhakim Bashir and Georgios Papachristou were instrumental in building upon my initial post. For Abdulhakim, his response was as follows:<br><br>

        <h2 id="assess2">Assessment: AI Application Solution</h2>
            <p>The second assignment was a direct continuation of the previous one. In this report, we had to come up with an experiment using one of the previously defined three key areas to demonstrate that our AI claims were achievable. My experiment focused on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions via machine learning (ML) algorithms, more specifically supervised learning approaches. To make the experiment as organised and reproducible as possible, the CRISP-DM process was employed.<br><br>

            <center><img src="https://www.sv-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screenshot-2016-04-20-11.58.54.png" height="500" width="600"><br>

            As such, the experiment focused on business understanding, data understanding and preparation, modelling and evaluation. Deployment was not addressed as it was out of scope, but recommendations were made when it comes to monitoring data and model drift.<br><br>
            
            When it comes to the candidate models that were considered, the following research-backed options were evaluated:<br><br>
            
            a) J48 (decision tree);<br> 
            b) Naive Bayes;<br>
            c) Random forest;<br>
            d) Logistic regression;<br>
            e) Multilayer perceptron.<br><br>
            
            The models were trained and evaluated using stratified k-fold cross-validation, and the best-fit model underwent a limited hyperparameter tuning process to ascertain if it could be improved even further. 
            
            </p><br><br>
                

            <h3 id="assess2-feedback"><br>Tutor feedback</h3>
                <p>Dr. Samuel Danso's feedback showed that my report's overall structure had greatly improved, although there was room for further improvement when it came to providing more details on what was being done. His feedback was as follows:<br><br>

        <h2 id="assess-outcome">Learning Outcome: Soft and Hard Skills in Business</h2>
            <p>The assignments were incredibly useful in demonstrating to students that, in industry (and even in academia), hard skills (such as programming) alone are not enough. Soft skills (such as communication) will always be required, especially for the following reasons:<br><br><br>
            
            a) <b>Technical barrier:</b> Business-oriented individuals will, in most cases, not have the technical depth and expertise that, for instance, a data scientist possesses. Communication must be levelled out so that they can understand what is being done and why;<br><br>

            b) <b>Politics:</b> Internal politics, such as department rivalries, must be navigated so that technical projects are not affected, and the only way of achieving this is by having a clear and direct line of communication, as well as good negotiating skills;<br><br>

            c) <b>Collaboration:</b> Technical projects often involve multiple teams with diverse expertise. Effective communication ensures that all team members are on the same page, which is essential for the successful completion of projects;<br><br>

            d) <b>Conflict resolution:</b> Conflicts are inevitable in any collaborative setting. Having strong interpersonal skills will prove instrumental in resolving conflicts amicably, ensuring that the focus remains on the project goals.

            </p><br><br>


        <h2 id="reflection">Reflective Piece</h2>
            <p>The "Understanding Artificial Intelligence" module was instrumental in not only introducing students to the world of AI, but also in enabling us to engage in meaningful and reference-backed discussions and conducting independent experiments. All of the tasks in the module required us to think independently and critically, evaluating all possible actions and outcomes in an impartial manner and choosing the best path based on the available constraints. The module was designed in such a way that it allowed even newcomers to the field to understand how complex implementing and maintaining AI systems is, both from technical and business perspectives.<br><br> 
            
            Additionally, the legal, ethical and professional principles behind AI are vast and were carefully addressed in the module, allowing students to grasp just how large of an impact this technology is making in modern society. This field is evolving in such a rapid pace that indiscriminate usage, both by individuals and companies alike, will result in substantial damage should it not be monitored and regulated effectively. Balancing this regulatory process will be important in allowing innovative creations to help shape the future of AI while blocking nefarious practices that may arise out of it.</p>
