        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>With Dr. Samuel Danso as our tutor, the "Knowledge Representation and Reasoning" module added more depth to students' understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) by exploring the very concept of representing the reasoning process exhibited by intelligent systems. It delved into topics such as ontology, set theory, and logic programming, some concepts that are often overlooked in AI but have proven important throughout its history, especially for symbolic computing. The module was instrumental in equipping students not only with practical and theoretical skills, but also the necessary mindset to engage in mature critical discussions with one another and stimulating us to explore this fascinating topic.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="unit1-activity">Unit 1 Activity</h2>
            <p>The first module activity consisted of addressing the following questions:<br><br>

            "<i>Look at the seven topics described briefly below. Which of them would you consider yourself as 'knowing', and which would you consider yourself as having information about?<br><br>

            a) A second language in which you are fluent.<br>
            b) The content of a television news programme.<br>
            c) A close friend.<br>
            d) A company's annual report.<br>
            e) Your close friend's partner whom you have yet to meet.<br>
            f) The weather on the other side of the world.<br>
            g) The weather where you are now.<br><br>

            What would you suggest is the primary characteristic that distinguishes the 'having information' situations from the 'knowing' situations you categorised in the previous activity? You will need to make sure that your description does not simply describe information or data but must particularly take account of the former."</i><br><br>

            For the first question, I believe that a) and c) constitute what I "know", and b), d), e), f) and g) constitute what I have information about. For the second question, the primary characteristic that distinguishes between "having information" and "knowing" is, to me, the following:<br><br>

            <b>Knowing:</b> You have an intrinsic knowledge of the subject in question, acquired through personal experiences and observations. It is internalised in you and does not depend on external factors. In essence, you alone hold dominion over what you know.<br>
            <b>Having information:</b> The knowledge is presented to you by a third party, such as an app, news channel or someone you know. It does not come from your own efforts and thus is not internalised, while also being influenced by external factors. In essence, it may be temporal information that is subjected to rules beyond your control.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="colab-1">Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
            <p>The first collaborative learning discussion served as a way for students to warm up to the module by discussing one of AI's peripheral themes. For it, we had the following topic to elaborate on:<br><br>
            
            "<i>Read the paper by Weststeijn, T. (2011) and then join the collaborative discussion below.<br><br>

            Knowledge Representation is a recent phenomenon - it only became a topic of discussion with the development of computing technology and the need to represent knowledge in computer systems.<br><br>

            a. Discuss this assertion. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion? Justify your position, supported with at least two academics references.<br>

            b. How is reasoning related to knowledge representation (KR)? Is KR still useful without reasoning support? Justify your answer supported by two academic references."</i><br><br>

            Students were required to create an initial post and, then, address at least 3 of their peers' submissions before creating a summary post. This final entry would serve as an evolved version of a student's initial post, incorporating peer responses and directly addressing them by either agreeing or not and providing the reasons for either case. My initial post, "Psychology, Logic, And Knowledge Representation", was as follows:<br><br>

            <h3 id="colab-11"><br>Peer feedback</h3>
                <p>The peer responses from James Adams and Zhu Zhang were instrumental in building upon my initial post. For James, his response was as follows:<br><br>

            <h3 id="colab-12"><br>Summary post</h3>
                <p>My initial entry was significantly enhanced by my peers' feedback. Their comments were addressed by my summary post, which was as follows:<br><br>

        <h2 id="unit2-seminar-prep"><br>Unit 2 Seminar Preparation</h2>
            <p>The second seminar consisted of answering the following questions on truth tables and logic:<br><br>

            "<i>1. Read Partee et al (1993) Chapter 1 and then attempt exercises 1 and 4, located at the end of the chapter.

            2. Read the wiki at Sharma et al (2022) and then attempt the exercises below:<br>
                i. For each clause (a) - (f) below, create truth tables for each to answer the question of when each statement is false.<br>
                    a. ~P<br>
                    b. P ∧ Q<br>
                    c. P v Q<br>
                    d. P → Q<br>
                    e. P ←→ Q<br>
                    f. P → (~Q)<br><br>

                ii. Consider the statement (~Q) -> (~P).<br>
                    a. When is it false?<br>
                    b. Now consider P → Q. When is it false?<br>
                    c. Do you believe these two compound statements mean the same thing?<br>
                    d. Construct the truth table for the statement (~Q) -> (~P). Then revisit your answer to (c).<br><br>

                iii. Construct the truth table for P XOR Q.<br><br>

                iv. Construct truth tables for the following statements.<br>

            Starting from exercises 1 and 4 in Partee et al. (1993), we have the following:<br><br>

            1. (X ∧ Y) ∧ (X v Y)<br>
            X ∧ Y (idempotence)<br><br>

            4. ((X ∧ X) ∧ Y) v ((X ∧ Y) ∧ Y)<br>
            ((X ∧ Y) v ((X ∧ Y) ∧ Y) (idempotence)<br>
            ((X ∧ Y) v (X ∧ (Y ∧ Y))) (associativity)<br>
            (X ∧ Y) v (X ∧ Y) (idempotence)<br>
            X ∧ Y (idempotence)<br><br>

            Now, for exercise ii., we have:<br><br>

            a. The statement (~Q) -> (~P) is false when ~P is True and ~Q is False.<br>
            b. The statement P → Q is false when P is True and Q is False.<br>
            c. In essence, yes. Both P → Q and (~Q) → (~P) wield the same results, but in different order.<br>
            d. The truth table for (~Q) → (~P) is:<br><br>

            <center><img src="img/knowledge_repr_and_reasoning/not_q_then_not_p.png" height="150" width="250"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 11: The truth table for (~Q) → (~P)</font></center><br><br>

            Comparing this truth table to the one from P → Q shows that the compound statements wield the same results, though in different order.<br><br>
            
            For exercise iii., we have:<br><br>

            Finally, for exercise iv., we have:<br><br>

            As can be seen, (P v Q) v R yields the same results as P v (Q v R). This is because (P v Q) v R = P v (Q v R) due to association.<br><br>

        <h2 id="unit3-activity">Unit 3 Activity</h2>
            <p>The third module activity consisted of the following:<br><br>

            "<i><b>Activity 1</b><br>
            Attempt the following questions from the module core text:<br><br>

            Chapter 2 Question 4 - The barber's paradox.<br>
            Chapter 3 Question 4 - A Canadian variant of an old puzzle.<br><br>

            <b>Activity 2</b><br>
            Read the paper by Palomino et al (2005) and review the 'crossing problem' diagram provided in the Lecturecast.<br><br>

            Create a set of statements in first-order logic (FOL) that represent the states shown - for example you may define two functions left and right and therefore the first state could be represented as: Left(F) and left(W) and Left(G) and left(C). Define your own set of FOL statements for the entire diagram.<br>
            You have been provided with solutions to the 'crossing problem' written in Lisp (here), Prolog (here) and Maude (here). Compare your FOL clauses with the various implementations - which of the implementations provides the closest match to your FOL version?</i>"<br><br>

            The chapter 2 question 4 question consists of the following:<br><br>

            "<i>In a certain town, there are the following regulations concerning the town barber:<br><br>

            a) Anyone who does not shave himself must be shaved by the barber.<br>
            b) Whomever the barber shaves, must not shave himself.<br><br>

            Show that no barber can fulfill these requirements. That is, formulate the requirements as sentences of FOL and show that in any interpretation where the first regulation is true, the second one must be false. (This is called the barber's paradox and was formulated by Bertrand Russell.)</i>"<br><br>

            For the first sentence, its FOL equivalent can be represented as:<br><br>

            ∀x(LivesInTown(x)) → (~Shaves(x, x) → Shaves(Barber, x))<br><br>

            As for the second sentence, its FOL equivalent is:<br><br>

            ∀x(LivesInTown(x)) → (Shaves(Barber, x) → ~Shaves(x, x))<br><br>

            This is an impossible scenario because, due to these regulations, the following happens:<br><br>

            a) If the barber does not shave himself, then by the first rule, he must be shaved by a barber, which means that he must shave himself.<br>
            b) If the barber does shave himself, then by the second rule, he must not shave himself.<br><br>

            The chapter 3 question 4 consists of the following:<br><br>

            "<i>A Canadian variant of an old puzzle:<br><br>

            A traveler in remote Quebec comes to a fork in the road and does not know which way to go to get to Chicoutimi. Henri and Pierre are two local inhabitants nearby who do know the way. One of them always tells the truth, and the other one never does, but the traveler does not know which is which. Is there a single question the traveler can ask Henri (in French, of course) that will be sure to tell him which way to go?<br>

            We will formalize this problem in FOL. Assume there are only two sorts of objects in our domain: inhabitants, denoted by the constants henri and pierre; and French questions, which Henri and Pierre can answer. These questions are denoted by the following terms:<br><br>

            * gauche, which asks if the traveler should take the left branch of the fork to get to Chicoutimi;<br>
            * dit_oui(x, q), which asks if inhabitant x would answer yes to the French question q;<br>
            * dit_non(x, q), which asks if inhabitant x would answer no to the French question q.<br><br>
            
            Obviously this is a somewhat impoverished dialect of French, although a philosophically interesting one. For example, the term<br><br>
            
            dit_non(henri, dit_oui(pierre, gauche))<br><br>
            
            represents a French question that might be translated as, “Would Henri answer no if I asked him if Pierre would say yes I should go to the left to get to Chicoutimi?” The predicate symbols of our language are the following:<br><br>

            * Truth_teller(x), which holds when inhabitant x is a truth-teller;<br>
            * Answer_yes(x, q), which holds when inhabitant x will answer yes to French question q;<br>
            * True(q), which holds when the correct answer to the question q is yes;<br>
            * Go_left, which holds if the direction to get to Chicoutimi is to go left.<br><br>

            For purposes of this puzzle, these are the only constant, function, and predicate symbols.<br><br>

            (a) Write FOL sentences for each of the following:<br><br>

            * One of Henri or Pierre is a truth-teller, and one is not.<br>
            * An inhabitant will answer yes to a question if and only if he is a truth teller and the correct answer is yes, or he is not a truth teller and the correct answer is not yes.<br>
            * The gauche question is correctly answered yes if and only if the proper direction is to go is left.<br>
            * A dit_oui(x, q) question is correctly answered yes if and only if x will answer yes to question q.<br>
            * A dit_non(x, q) question is correctly answered yes if and only if x will not answer yes to q.<br><br>

            Imagine that these facts make up the entire KB of the traveler.<br><br>
            
            (b) Show that there is a ground term t such that<br><br>

            KB |= (Answer_yes(henri, t) = Go_left)<br><br>

            In other words, there is a question t that can be asked to Henri (and there is an analogous one for Pierre) that will be answered yes if and only if the proper direction to get to Chicoutimi is to go left.<br>

            (c) Show that this KB does not entail which direction to go, that is, show that there is an interpretation satisfying the KB where Go_left is true, and another one where it is false.</i>"<br><br>

            For a), we have:<br><br>

            <b>* One of Henri or Pierre is a truth-teller, and one is not.</b><br><br>

            Truth_teller(henri) ⊕ Truth_teller(pierre)<br><br>

            <b>* An inhabitant will answer yes to a question if and only if he is a truth teller and the correct answer is yes, or he is not a truth teller and the correct answer is not yes.</b><br><br>

            Answer_yes(x, q) ←→ (Truth_teller(x) ∧ True(q)) v (~Truth_teller(x) ∧ ~True(q))<br><br>

            <b>* The gauche question is correctly answered yes if and only if the proper direction is to go is left.</b><br><br>

            True(gauche) ←→ Go_left<br><br>

            <b>* A dit_oui(x, q) question is correctly answered yes if and only if x will answer yes to question q.</b><br><br>

            True(dit_oui(x, q)) ←→ Answer_yes(x, q)<br><br>

            <b>* A dit_non(x, q) question is correctly answered yes if and only if x will not answer yes to q.</b><br><br>

            True(dit_non(x, q)) ←→ ~Answer_yes(x, q)<br><br>

            As for b), we have to recall that Henri can speak the truth as a truth-teller or lie if he isn't. To ascertain this, we could ask him if he would say yes to going left if Pierre would also say yes, which we can formulate as:<br><br>

            dit_oui(henri, dit_oui(pierre, gauche))<br><br>

            So, we have:<br><br>

            i. If Henri is the truth-teller, then Pierre is a liar. Pierre would say no to the correct answer if the correct direction is left. Henri would truthfully report Pierre's response, which is no.<br>
            ii. If Henri is a liar, then Pierre is truthful and would say yes to the correct answer. Being a liar, Henri would say the opposite.<br>
            iii. If the correct direction is to go left, the answer will be yes.<br>
            iv. If the correct direction is to go right, the answer will be no.<br><br>

            Thus, we can set:<br><br>

            t = dit_oui(henri, dit_oui(pierre, gauche))<br><br>

            This satisfies:<br><br>

            KB |= (Answer_yes(henri, t) = Go_left)<br><br>

            This proves that the traveller can ask this question to determine the correct path.<br><br>

            Finally, for c), since Go_left is a predicate and not a logical consequence of any other predicates in the KB, it can be assigned independently. Thus, we have the following:<br><br>

            i. A model where Go_left is true, meaning left is correct.<br>
            i. A model where Go_left is false, meaning right is correct.<br><br>

            Both models satisfy the KB, proving that it does not entail whether the correct direction is left or right.<br><br>

            For the second part of the exercise, the following is a diagram of the crossing problem:<br><br>

            <center><img src="img/knowledge_repr_and_reasoning/diagram.png" height="400" width="650"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 17: The crossing problem diagram</font></center><br><br>

            We can see a sequence of states and movements required to get to each of them. We could use the following FOL statements for each state:<br><br>

            <b>state (w, w, w, w):</b> West(F) ∧ West(W) ∧ West(G) ∧ West(C)<br><br>
            <b>state (e, w, e, w):</b> East(F) ∧ West(W) ∧ East(G) ∧ West(C)<br><br>
            <b>state (w, w, e, w):</b> West(F) ∧ West(W) ∧ East(G) ∧ West(C)<br><br>
            <b>state (e, w, e, e):</b> East(F) ∧ West(W) ∧ East(G) ∧ East(C)<br><br>
            <b>state (w, w, w, e):</b> West(F) ∧ West(W) ∧ West(G) ∧ East(C)<br><br>
            <b>state (e, e, w, e):</b> East(F) ∧ East(W) ∧ West(G) ∧ East(C)<br><br>
            <b>state (w, e, w, e):</b> West(F) ∧ East(W) ∧ West(G) ∧ East(C)<br><br>

            As can be seen in the solutions, the closest match to my FOL version is offered by the one written in Prolog, being closely followed by the Maude version.

        <h2 id="colab-2"><br>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h2>
            <p>The second collaborative learning discussion further honed students' argumentative skills. This time, we had to elaborate on the following topic:<br><br>

            <i>"Identify and discuss two machine learning algorithms and the context in which they can be employed.<br><br>

            Your discussion could consider:<br><br>

            a) Supervised and/or unsupervised learning algorithms. For example, if considering supervised learning, what type of learning algorithms would be ideal for the solution? <br>
            b)The strengths and weaknesses of this approach to learning.<br><br>
            
            You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (journals, books, reports, etc.). This is activity will provide evidence of your personal growth."</i><br><br>
            
            The second collaborative discussion followed the same structure as the first discussion, where a student had to submit an initial post, address at least 3 of their peers' entries and then create a summary post that incorporated peer responses submitted in the initial entry. My initial post, "Autoencoders and imitation learning", focused on giving an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of these, respectively, unsupervised and supervised algorithms</p>    

            
            <h3 id="colab-21"><br>Peer feedback</h3>
                <p>My initial entry was significantly enhanced by the comments from two of my peers, Pëllumb Dalipi and Georgios Papachristou. For Pëllumb, his response was as follows:

        <h2 id="colab-outcome">Learning Outcome: Peer Discussions</h2>
            <p>The collaborative learning discussions allowed me to engage with my peers in informative and respectful discussions regarding the proposed topics, thus contributing to my growth in two very important aspects:<br><br><br>
            
            a) <b>Critical thinking:</b> The topics were, by nature, geared towards instigating students to work on identifying and addressing their positive and negative aspects. By the time that we had to take part in the second discussion forum, I was much more proficient at thinking critically and this skill only improved by the end of the second collaborative learning discussion;<br><br>
            
            b) <b>Collaboration:</b> I interacted with several students' posts and directly addressed the content present in them. Not only did I agree or disagree as required but I also provided further material that could be of interest to my peers, such as articles and papers, thus collaborating with them in broadening our perspective of a given topic.<br><br>
            
            </p><br><br>


        <h2 id="assess1">Assessment: Artificial Intelligence and its Applications</h2>
            <p>The first assessment involved coming up with a report that would convince the leadership of a ficticious finance startup to adopt AI technologies. The company that I created had the following profile:<br><br> 
            
            <i>Orion is a recently established finance company that specialises in efficient and secure payment processing operations and investment management, offering customers a team of investment specialists to optimise their portfolios and perform quantitative trading. Founded by industry veterans and academics, the company seeks to combine corporate and research-based methods to bring innovation to the finance industry, which is known for its high stakes and competitive nature.</i><br><br>

            The report contained the positive and negative aspects behind AI adoption, the challenges involved in such an action (such as dataset gathering and infrastructure requirements) and the potential boons that could be unlocked by Orion should it make use of this technology responsibly and ethically. Three key areas were identified that could be significantly enhanced by AI adoption, which were:<br><br><br>

            a) <b>Investment planning and execution</b>, with AI being employed in tasks such as forecast generation on market trends, market sentiment analysis and trading bots;<br><br>

            b) <b>Fraud detection</b>, with AI being employed in tasks such as detecting anomalous credit card transactions and email phishing attempts;<br><br>

            c) <b>Customer service</b>, with AI being employed in tasks such as automated customer assistance via chatbots and predicting user needs or issues.
            
            </p><br><br>
            

            <h3 id="assess1-feedback"><br>Tutor feedback</h3>
                <p>Dr. Samuel Danso's feedback allowed me to see the flaws in my report, such as the lack of reference-backed examples. His response was instrumental in allowing me to improve my report for the next assignment, and was as follows<br><br>
                
                <center><img src="img/understanding_ai/tutor_feedback_assign1.png" height="500" width="1200"><br>
                
                <font size="2">Figure 9: Tutor feedback on the first assignment</font></center><br><br>
                
                </p><br><br>


        <h2 id="assess2">Assessment: AI Application Solution</h2>
            <p>The second assignment was a direct continuation of the previous one. In this report, we had to come up with an experiment using one of the previously defined three key areas to demonstrate that our AI claims were achievable. My experiment focused on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions via machine learning (ML) algorithms, more specifically supervised learning approaches. To make the experiment as organised and reproducible as possible, the CRISP-DM process was employed.<br><br>

            <center><img src="https://www.sv-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screenshot-2016-04-20-11.58.54.png" height="500" width="600"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 10: The CRISP-DM process (<a href="https://www.sv-europe.com/crisp-dm-methodology/">Smart Vision Europe</a>)</font></center><br><br>

            As such, the experiment focused on business understanding, data understanding and preparation, modelling and evaluation. Deployment was not addressed as it was out of scope, but recommendations were made when it comes to monitoring data and model drift.<br><br>
            
            When it comes to the candidate models that were considered, the following research-backed options were evaluated:<br><br>
            
            a) J48 (decision tree);<br> 
            b) Naive Bayes;<br>
            c) Random forest;<br>
            d) Logistic regression;<br>
            e) Multilayer perceptron.<br><br>
            
            The models were trained and evaluated using stratified k-fold cross-validation, and the best-fit model underwent a limited hyperparameter tuning process to ascertain if it could be improved even further. 
            
            </p><br><br>
                

            <h3 id="assess2-feedback"><br>Tutor feedback</h3>
                <p>Dr. Samuel Danso's feedback showed that my report's overall structure had greatly improved, although there was room for further improvement when it came to providing more details on what was being done. His feedback was as follows:<br><br>
                
                <center><img src="img/understanding_ai/tutor_feedback_assign2.png" height="350" width="1200"><br>

                </p><br><br>
        
    
        <h2 id="assess-outcome">Learning Outcome: Soft and Hard Skills in Business</h2>
            <p>The assignments were incredibly useful in demonstrating to students that, in industry (and even in academia), hard skills (such as programming) alone are not enough. Soft skills (such as communication) will always be required, especially for the following reasons:<br><br><br>
            
            a) <b>Technical barrier:</b> Business-oriented individuals will, in most cases, not have the technical depth and expertise that, for instance, a data scientist possesses. Communication must be levelled out so that they can understand what is being done and why;<br><br>

            b) <b>Politics:</b> Internal politics, such as department rivalries, must be navigated so that technical projects are not affected, and the only way of achieving this is by having a clear and direct line of communication, as well as good negotiating skills;<br><br>

            c) <b>Collaboration:</b> Technical projects often involve multiple teams with diverse expertise. Effective communication ensures that all team members are on the same page, which is essential for the successful completion of projects;<br><br>

            d) <b>Conflict resolution:</b> Conflicts are inevitable in any collaborative setting. Having strong interpersonal skills will prove instrumental in resolving conflicts amicably, ensuring that the focus remains on the project goals.

            </p><br><br>


        <h2 id="reflection">Reflective Piece</h2>
            <p>The "Understanding Artificial Intelligence" module was instrumental in not only introducing students to the world of AI, but also in enabling us to engage in meaningful and reference-backed discussions and conducting independent experiments. All of the tasks in the module required us to think independently and critically, evaluating all possible actions and outcomes in an impartial manner and choosing the best path based on the available constraints. The module was designed in such a way that it allowed even newcomers to the field to understand how complex implementing and maintaining AI systems is, both from technical and business perspectives.<br><br> 
            
            Additionally, the legal, ethical and professional principles behind AI are vast and were carefully addressed in the module, allowing students to grasp just how large of an impact this technology is making in modern society. This field is evolving in such a rapid pace that indiscriminate usage, both by individuals and companies alike, will result in substantial damage should it not be monitored and regulated effectively. Balancing this regulatory process will be important in allowing innovative creations to help shape the future of AI while blocking nefarious practices that may arise out of it.</p>
