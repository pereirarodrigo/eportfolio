        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>With Karen Outram as our tutor, the "Research Methods and Professional Practice" module introduced students to practical foundations in research methods that were instrumental in enabling students to conduct research in a practical setting. Notably, the module covered various tools and techniques that are vital to any researcher, such as the scientific method and ethics, collection and analysis of data types, research strategies, and academic writing. Furthermore, the module also provided essential insight into the legal, social, ethical and professional issues applicable to computing projects, as well as the relevant codes of practice that researchers must adhere to.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="reflective1">Reflective Activity 1: Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI</h2>
            <p>The first module assignment consisted of a reflective piece, which had to be elaborated according to the following:<br><br>

            <i>"Read Corrêa et al. (2023) and Deckard (2023).<br><br>

                From late 2022, generative AI has taken the world by storm, and there is no field of activity that has not been impacted in some way. This is so much truer for Computer Science, which is where it all began. It is important to realise, however, that AI itself is nothing new, per se; and if the renaissance of the field after the ‘winter’ of the 1980s has been slow but constant, today there is the need of a different set of rules.<br><br>

                In the Corrêa et al (2023) paper, the authors state that 'a lot of work is taking place to define the values and ideas that should guide AI advances. A key challenge, however, lies in establishing a consensus on these values, given the diverse perspectives of various stakeholders worldwide and the abstraction of normative discourse. Researchers and policy makers need better tools to catalogue and compare AI governance documents from around the world and to identify points of divergence and commonality.'<br><br>

                After reviewing the article and reading how different countries across the world deal with the generative AI revolution, discuss your views on the subject and recommend what you think could be a suitable course of action. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant literature (additional links to industry have been provided as ‘Other Resources’ to the module). Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional issues. Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help you evaluate the legal, social ethical and professional issues that affect computing professionals in industry."</i><br><br>

            <strong>Evaluating AI Ethics and Governance in the Generative AI Era</strong><br><br>

            The rapid ascent of generative AI, exemplified by models like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and AlphaCode, has triggered a global reckoning with the ethical, legal, social, and professional responsibilities surrounding artificial intelligence. The review by Corrêa et al. (2023), encompassing over 200 global AI ethics guidelines, and Deckard’s concise overview (2023) both highlight the fragmented yet converging concerns nations share about this technological shift. Yet, despite growing consensus on ethical principles like transparency, accountability, and fairness, stark asymmetries in regulation, enforcement, and cultural framing persist.<br><br>

            <strong>Global Ethical Convergence vs. Local Fragmentation</strong><br><br>

            The study by Corrêa et al. (2023) reveals that most AI guidelines—irrespective of origin—emphasize five core principles: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability. These are echoed across regions, from the EU’s High-Level Expert Group on AI (European Commission, 2024) to Japan’s Social Principles of Human-Centric AI (Cabinet Secretariat, 2019) and Brazil’s PL 2338/2023 on AI national strategy (UNESCO, N.D.). However, the actual implementation of these principles varies significantly. While the EU has made strides toward binding regulation with its AI Act, other regions like Latin America and parts of Asia rely primarily on non-binding guidelines or industry-led codes of conduct. This discrepancy creates ethical blind spots and legal uncertainty, especially when generative AI systems cross jurisdictional borders.<br><br>

            For instance, a model trained in a lightly regulated country may later be deployed in stricter regions, raising concerns about imported biases, data privacy violations, or unvetted use cases. The lack of standardized global enforcement exacerbates the risk of AI misuse, especially in domains like facial recognition, disinformation generation, or synthetic media fraud.<br><br>

            <strong>The Professional Dilemma: Between Innovation and Responsibility</strong><br><br>

            From a professional standpoint, computing practitioners often find themselves at the crossroads of technical innovation and ethical uncertainty. While many developers are motivated by intellectual curiosity or economic incentives, the unintended consequences of generative AI, such as copyright infringement, misinformation propagation, and labor displacement, are rarely considered in early development cycles. Therefore, many ethical concerns in AI arise when a particular system is already available for use, thus making the propagation of such undesired effects almost inevitable.<br><br>

            Deckard (2023) argues that ethics must be embedded not just in regulation, but in professional culture. The British Computer Society (British Computer Society, 2024), ACM (ACM, 2018), and IEEE (IEEE Standards Association, 2023), for example, emphasize that developers must actively mitigate harm, respect data privacy, and ensure inclusivity. Yet such ideals can be hard to uphold when commercial pressures prioritize speed and market dominance. Hence, a more deeply ingrained ethical mindset—beyond checklist compliance—is needed in technical education, hiring practices, and project management.

            <strong>Recommended Course of Action</strong><br><br>
            
            Given this context, a multilayered governance approach is essential. I recommend the following actions:

            <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Mandatory Impact Assessments:</strong> any organization developing or deploying generative AI should be required to conduct socio-technical impact assessments—similar to data protection impact assessments under GDPR. These should cover risks like output bias, explainability gaps, dual-use misuse, and labor disruption.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>AI ethics by design:</strong> development pipelines should embed ethics as a first-class component, not an afterthought. This includes incorporating fairness metrics, model interpretability tools, and human-in-the-loop feedback from the earliest stages of model training.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>International harmonisation with cultural sensitivity:</strong> while global AI principles should converge on shared values (e.g., dignity, fairness), implementation must allow for cultural adaptation. For example, autonomy may carry different weight in collectivist societies compared to individualistic ones. This calls for globally aligned yet locally adaptable ethical frameworks.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Legal backstops for high-risk AI:</strong> in line with the EU AI Act, any generative AI system with potential for significant harm (e.g., autonomous weapons, deceptive media generation, biometric surveillance) should be tightly regulated, with legal liabilities attached to both developers and deployers.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Public AI literacy and feedback channels:</strong> ethical AI cannot succeed without public understanding and input. Educational programs and community feedback mechanisms should be institutionalized, especially in marginalized regions disproportionately affected by AI decisions.<br><br>
            </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Legal, Social, and Professional Impact</strong><br><br>

            Legally, such actions would clarify developer liability, reduce regulatory arbitrage, and ensure user rights (such as opt-out mechanisms or contestable decisions) are enforceable. Socially, improved transparency and oversight could mitigate erosion of trust in digital media and democratic discourse. Professionally, computing practitioners would be held to higher accountability standards, which could shift hiring and certification practices to prioritize ethics and interdisciplinary knowledge.<br><br>

            Crucially, these actions would not stifle innovation, but rather channel it toward socially constructive outcomes. Ethical rigor and technological advancement are not mutually exclusive—rather, they are complementary in ensuring that AI serves human flourishing.<br><br>

            <strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>

            The global AI ethics landscape, while increasingly unified in language, remains divergent in practice. Bridging the gap between ethical intention and operational reality will require robust governance, professional responsibility, and active societal participation. Generative AI, with its creative potential and disruptive force, must be guided not just by what we can build, but by what we should.<br><br>

        <h2 id="colab-1">Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
            <p>The first collaborative learning discussion served as an introduction for students when it comes to discussing themes related to AI. For it, we had the following topic to elaborate on:<br><br>
            
            "<i>Discuss why Artificial Intelligence is now ubiquitous and why it is important for companies to invest in Artificial Intelligence technologies. <br><br>

            Your discussion could consider/identify:<br><br>
                
                a) A typical company or industry that employs AI technologies, as well as the nature of the business to set the context for the discussion.<br>
                b) The economic benefits to the company or industry, and other implications of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology.<br><br>

            You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (journals, books, reports, etc.). This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth."</i><br><br>

            Students were required to create an initial post and, then, address at least 3 of their peers' submissions before creating a summary post. This final entry would serve as an evolved version of a student's initial post, incorporating peer responses and directly addressing them by either agreeing or not and providing the reasons for either case. My initial post, "The impact of artificial intelligence-driven consulting companies", discussed the organizational and ethical impact of consulting companies that make heavy use of AI, to the point of being considered AI-driven.</p><br><br>

            
            <h3 id="colab-11"><br>Peer feedback</h3>
                <p>The peer responses from Mateusz Niewczas and Guilherme Pessoa-Amorim, two of my peers, were instrumental in building upon my initial post. For Mateusz, his response was as follows.<br><br>

                <font size="2">Figure 1: Mateusz's peer response to my initial post</font></center><br><br>

                As for Guilherme, his response was the following:<br><br><br>

            <h3 id="colab-12"><br>Summary post</h3>
                <p>My initial entry was significantly enhanced by my peers' feedback. Their comments were addressed by my summary post, which was as follows:<br><br>

                <center><img src="img/understanding_ai/summary_post_disc1.png" height="550" width="1200"><br>
                
                <font size="2">Figure 3: My summary post in the first discussion forum</font></center><br><br>


        <h2 id="colab-2"><br>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h2>
            <p>The second collaborative learning discussion further honed students' argumentative skills. This time, we had to elaborate on the following topic:<br><br>

            <i>"Identify and discuss two machine learning algorithms and the context in which they can be employed.<br><br>

            Your discussion could consider:<br><br>

            a) Supervised and/or unsupervised learning algorithms. For example, if considering supervised learning, what type of learning algorithms would be ideal for the solution? <br>
            b)The strengths and weaknesses of this approach to learning.<br><br>
            
            You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (journals, books, reports, etc.). This is activity will provide evidence of your personal growth."</i><br><br>
            
            The second collaborative discussion followed the same structure as the first discussion, where a student had to submit an initial post, address at least 3 of their peers' entries and then create a summary post that incorporated peer responses submitted in the initial entry. My initial post, "Autoencoders and imitation learning", focused on giving an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of these, respectively, unsupervised and supervised algorithms</p>    

            
            <h3 id="colab-21"><br>Peer feedback</h3>
                <p>My initial entry was significantly enhanced by the comments from two of my peers, Pëllumb Dalipi and Georgios Papachristou. For Pëllumb, his response was as follows:

                As for Guilherme, his response was the following:<br><br><br>

            <h3 id="colab-22"><br>Summary post</h3>
                <p>My initial entry was, like in the previous discussion forum, significantly enhanced by my peers' feedback. Their comments were addressed by my summary post, which was as follows:<br><br>
                <center><img src="img/understanding_ai/summary_post_disc1.png" height="550" width="1200"><br>

        <h2 id="colab-outcome">Learning Outcome: Peer Discussions</h2>
            <p>The collaborative learning discussions allowed me to engage with my peers in informative and respectful discussions regarding the proposed topics, thus contributing to my growth in two very important aspects:<br><br><br>
            
            a) <strong>Critical thinking:</strong> The topics were, by nature, geared towards instigating students to work on identifying and addressing their positive and negative aspects. By the time that we had to take part in the second discussion forum, I was much more proficient at thinking critically and this skill only improved by the end of the second collaborative learning discussion;<br><br>
            
            b) <strong>Collaboration:</strong> I interacted with several students' posts and directly addressed the content present in them. Not only did I agree or disagree as required but I also provided further material that could be of interest to my peers, such as articles and papers, thus collaborating with them in broadening our perspective of a given topic.<br><br>
            
            </p><br><br>


        <h2 id="assess1">Assessment: Artificial Intelligence and its Applications</h2>
            <p>The first assessment involved coming up with a report that would convince the leadership of a ficticious finance startup to adopt AI technologies. The company that I created had the following profile:<br><br> 
            
            <i>Orion is a recently established finance company that specialises in efficient and secure payment processing operations and investment management, offering customers a team of investment specialists to optimise their portfolios and perform quantitative trading. Founded by industry veterans and academics, the company seeks to combine corporate and research-based methods to bring innovation to the finance industry, which is known for its high stakes and competitive nature.</i><br><br>

            The report contained the positive and negative aspects behind AI adoption, the challenges involved in such an action (such as dataset gathering and infrastructure requirements) and the potential boons that could be unlocked by Orion should it make use of this technology responsibly and ethically. Three key areas were identified that could be significantly enhanced by AI adoption, which were:<br><br><br>

            a) <strong>Investment planning and execution</strong>, with AI being employed in tasks such as forecast generation on market trends, market sentiment analysis and trading bots;<br><br>

            b) <strong>Fraud detection</strong>, with AI being employed in tasks such as detecting anomalous credit card transactions and email phishing attempts;<br><br>

            c) <strong>Customer service</strong>, with AI being employed in tasks such as automated customer assistance via chatbots and predicting user needs or issues.
            
            </p><br><br>
            

            <h3 id="assess1-feedback"><br>Tutor feedback</h3>
                <p>Dr. Samuel Danso's feedback allowed me to see the flaws in my report, such as the lack of reference-backed examples. His response was instrumental in allowing me to improve my report for the next assignment, and was as follows<br><br>
                
                <center><img src="img/understanding_ai/tutor_feedback_assign1.png" height="500" width="1200"><br>
                
                <font size="2">Figure 9: Tutor feedback on the first assignment</font></center><br><br>
                
                </p><br><br>


        <h2 id="assess2">Assessment: AI Application Solution</h2>
            <p>The second assignment was a direct continuation of the previous one. In this report, we had to come up with an experiment using one of the previously defined three key areas to demonstrate that our AI claims were achievable. My experiment focused on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions via machine learning (ML) algorithms, more specifically supervised learning approaches. To make the experiment as organised and reproducible as possible, the CRISP-DM process was employed.<br><br>

            <center><img src="https://www.sv-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screenshot-2016-04-20-11.58.54.png" height="500" width="600"><br>

            As such, the experiment focused on business understanding, data understanding and preparation, modelling and evaluation. Deployment was not addressed as it was out of scope, but recommendations were made when it comes to monitoring data and model drift.<br><br>
            
            When it comes to the candidate models that were considered, the following research-backed options were evaluated:<br><br>
            
            a) J48 (decision tree);<br> 
            b) Naive Bayes;<br>
            c) Random forest;<br>
            d) Logistic regression;<br>
            e) Multilayer perceptron.<br><br>
            
            The models were trained and evaluated using stratified k-fold cross-validation, and the best-fit model underwent a limited hyperparameter tuning process to ascertain if it could be improved even further. 
            
            </p><br><br>
                

            <h3 id="assess2-feedback"><br>Tutor feedback</h3>
                <p>Dr. Samuel Danso's feedback showed that my report's overall structure had greatly improved, although there was room for further improvement when it came to providing more details on what was being done. His feedback was as follows:<br><br>

            <p>The assignments were incredibly useful in demonstrating to students that, in industry (and even in academia), hard skills (such as programming) alone are not enough. Soft skills (such as communication) will always be required, especially for the following reasons:<br><br><br>
            
            a) <strong>Technical barrier:</strong> Business-oriented individuals will, in most cases, not have the technical depth and expertise that, for instance, a data scientist possesses. Communication must be levelled out so that they can understand what is being done and why;<br><br>

            b) <strong>Politics:</strong> Internal politics, such as department rivalries, must be navigated so that technical projects are not affected, and the only way of achieving this is by having a clear and direct line of communication, as well as good negotiating skills;<br><br>

            c) <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Technical projects often involve multiple teams with diverse expertise. Effective communication ensures that all team members are on the same page, which is essential for the successful completion of projects;<br><br>

            d) <strong>Conflict resolution:</strong> Conflicts are inevitable in any collaborative setting. Having strong interpersonal skills will prove instrumental in resolving conflicts amicably, ensuring that the focus remains on the project goals.

        <h2 id="reflection">Reflective Piece</h2>
            <p>The "Understanding Artificial Intelligence" module was instrumental in not only introducing students to the world of AI, but also in enabling us to engage in meaningful and reference-backed discussions and conducting independent experiments. All of the tasks in the module required us to think independently and critically, evaluating all possible actions and outcomes in an impartial manner and choosing the best path based on the available constraints. The module was designed in such a way that it allowed even newcomers to the field to understand how complex implementing and maintaining AI systems is, both from technical and business perspectives.<br><br> 
            
            Additionally, the legal, ethical and professional principles behind AI are vast and were carefully addressed in the module, allowing students to grasp just how large of an impact this technology is making in modern society. This field is evolving in such a rapid pace that indiscriminate usage, both by individuals and companies alike, will result in substantial damage should it not be monitored and regulated effectively. Balancing this regulatory process will be important in allowing innovative creations to help shape the future of AI while blocking nefarious practices that may arise out of it.</p>
