        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>With Karen Outram as our tutor, the "Research Methods and Professional Practice" module introduced students to practical foundations in research methods that were instrumental in enabling students to conduct research in a practical setting. Notably, the module covered various tools and techniques that are vital to any researcher, such as the scientific method and ethics, collection and analysis of data types, research strategies, and academic writing. Furthermore, the module also provided essential insight into the legal, social, ethical and professional issues applicable to computing projects, as well as the relevant codes of practice that researchers must adhere to.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="reflective1">Reflective Activity 1: Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI</h2>
            <p>The first module assignment consisted of a reflective piece, which had to be elaborated according to the following:<br><br>

            <i>"Read Corrêa et al. (2023) and Deckard (2023).<br><br>

                From late 2022, generative AI has taken the world by storm, and there is no field of activity that has not been impacted in some way. This is so much truer for Computer Science, which is where it all began. It is important to realise, however, that AI itself is nothing new, per se; and if the renaissance of the field after the ‘winter’ of the 1980s has been slow but constant, today there is the need of a different set of rules.<br><br>

                In the Corrêa et al (2023) paper, the authors state that 'a lot of work is taking place to define the values and ideas that should guide AI advances. A key challenge, however, lies in establishing a consensus on these values, given the diverse perspectives of various stakeholders worldwide and the abstraction of normative discourse. Researchers and policy makers need better tools to catalogue and compare AI governance documents from around the world and to identify points of divergence and commonality.'<br><br>

                After reviewing the article and reading how different countries across the world deal with the generative AI revolution, discuss your views on the subject and recommend what you think could be a suitable course of action. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant literature (additional links to industry have been provided as ‘Other Resources’ to the module). Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional issues. Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help you evaluate the legal, social ethical and professional issues that affect computing professionals in industry."</i><br><br>

            <strong>Evaluating AI Ethics and Governance in the Generative AI Era</strong><br><br>

            The rapid ascent of generative AI, exemplified by models like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and AlphaCode, has triggered a global reckoning with the ethical, legal, social, and professional responsibilities surrounding artificial intelligence. The review by Corrêa et al. (2023), encompassing over 200 global AI ethics guidelines, and Deckard’s concise overview (2023) both highlight the fragmented yet converging concerns nations share about this technological shift. Yet, despite growing consensus on ethical principles like transparency, accountability, and fairness, stark asymmetries in regulation, enforcement, and cultural framing persist.<br><br>

            <strong>Global Ethical Convergence vs. Local Fragmentation</strong><br><br>

            The study by Corrêa et al. (2023) reveals that most AI guidelines—irrespective of origin—emphasize five core principles: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability. These are echoed across regions, from the EU’s High-Level Expert Group on AI (European Commission, 2024) to Japan’s Social Principles of Human-Centric AI (Cabinet Secretariat, 2019) and Brazil’s PL 2338/2023 on AI national strategy (UNESCO, N.D.). However, the actual implementation of these principles varies significantly. While the EU has made strides toward binding regulation with its AI Act, other regions like Latin America and parts of Asia rely primarily on non-binding guidelines or industry-led codes of conduct. This discrepancy creates ethical blind spots and legal uncertainty, especially when generative AI systems cross jurisdictional borders.<br><br>

            For instance, a model trained in a lightly regulated country may later be deployed in stricter regions, raising concerns about imported biases, data privacy violations, or unvetted use cases. The lack of standardized global enforcement exacerbates the risk of AI misuse, especially in domains like facial recognition, disinformation generation, or synthetic media fraud.<br><br>

            <strong>The Professional Dilemma: Between Innovation and Responsibility</strong><br><br>

            From a professional standpoint, computing practitioners often find themselves at the crossroads of technical innovation and ethical uncertainty. While many developers are motivated by intellectual curiosity or economic incentives, the unintended consequences of generative AI, such as copyright infringement, misinformation propagation, and labor displacement, are rarely considered in early development cycles. Therefore, many ethical concerns in AI arise when a particular system is already available for use, thus making the propagation of such undesired effects almost inevitable.<br><br>

            Deckard (2023) argues that ethics must be embedded not just in regulation, but in professional culture. The British Computer Society (British Computer Society, 2024), ACM (ACM, 2018), and IEEE (IEEE Standards Association, 2023), for example, emphasize that developers must actively mitigate harm, respect data privacy, and ensure inclusivity. Yet such ideals can be hard to uphold when commercial pressures prioritize speed and market dominance. Hence, a more deeply ingrained ethical mindset—beyond checklist compliance—is needed in technical education, hiring practices, and project management.

            <strong>Recommended Course of Action</strong><br><br>
            
            Given this context, a multilayered governance approach is essential. I recommend the following actions:

            <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Mandatory Impact Assessments:</strong> any organization developing or deploying generative AI should be required to conduct socio-technical impact assessments—similar to data protection impact assessments under GDPR. These should cover risks like output bias, explainability gaps, dual-use misuse, and labor disruption.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>AI ethics by design:</strong> development pipelines should embed ethics as a first-class component, not an afterthought. This includes incorporating fairness metrics, model interpretability tools, and human-in-the-loop feedback from the earliest stages of model training.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>International harmonisation with cultural sensitivity:</strong> while global AI principles should converge on shared values (e.g., dignity, fairness), implementation must allow for cultural adaptation. For example, autonomy may carry different weight in collectivist societies compared to individualistic ones. This calls for globally aligned yet locally adaptable ethical frameworks.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Legal backstops for high-risk AI:</strong> in line with the EU AI Act, any generative AI system with potential for significant harm (e.g., autonomous weapons, deceptive media generation, biometric surveillance) should be tightly regulated, with legal liabilities attached to both developers and deployers.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Public AI literacy and feedback channels:</strong> ethical AI cannot succeed without public understanding and input. Educational programs and community feedback mechanisms should be institutionalized, especially in marginalized regions disproportionately affected by AI decisions.<br><br>
            </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Legal, Social, and Professional Impact</strong><br><br>

            Legally, such actions would clarify developer liability, reduce regulatory arbitrage, and ensure user rights (such as opt-out mechanisms or contestable decisions) are enforceable. Socially, improved transparency and oversight could mitigate erosion of trust in digital media and democratic discourse. Professionally, computing practitioners would be held to higher accountability standards, which could shift hiring and certification practices to prioritize ethics and interdisciplinary knowledge.<br><br>

            Crucially, these actions would not stifle innovation, but rather channel it toward socially constructive outcomes. Ethical rigor and technological advancement are not mutually exclusive—rather, they are complementary in ensuring that AI serves human flourishing.<br><br>

            <strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>

            The global AI ethics landscape, while increasingly unified in language, remains divergent in practice. Bridging the gap between ethical intention and operational reality will require robust governance, professional responsibility, and active societal participation. Generative AI, with its creative potential and disruptive force, must be guided not just by what we can build, but by what we should.<br><br>

        <h2 id="eportfolio1">e-Portfolio Activity: Literature Review and Research Proposal Outlines</h2>
            <p>The first e-portfolio activity consisted of the following:<br><br>
            
            <i>"Start planning your literature review based on your chosen topic from the list provided in unit 1. Your outline of the literature review can be submitted for formative feedback in unit 4 before final submission in unit 7. You can use the guidance document for the outline submission, and to prepare your review.<br><br>

            You should also take some time to consider your research proposal which could be based around the area you have chosen to investigate in your literature review or the topic of your capstone project (MSc students). Your outline of the proposal can be submitted for formative feedback in unit 8 before final submission in unit 10. Units 8 and 9 will be focussed on analysing data which, along with research methods, will also need to be considered in your presentation."</i><br><br>

            My literature review, titled "Uplifting Voices: Technology as a Means of Language Preservation", will be focused on exploring how technology, especially artificial intelligence-related methods, can be used to not only ensure the continued relevance of minority languages but also safeguard their future via preservation in digital form. The outline will be submitted for formative feedback in unit 4.<br><br>

            As for my capstone project, it's titled "Simulating Risk-Based Decision-Making and Dopaminergic Dysfunctions Using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning". In it, I aim to develop a prototype system that can simulate risk-based decision making with dopaminergetic stimuli, as well as dopamine depletion and overactivity, in a gambling scenario by leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning. The outline will be submitted for formative feedback in unit 8.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="colab-1">Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
            <p>The first collaborative learning discussion served as a way for students to warm up to the module by discussing about ethics and codes of conduct in AI. For it, we had the following topic to elaborate on:<br><br>
            
            "<i>Pick a case study from the examples provided by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).<br><br>

            Review the application of the ethics code to the situation described and highlight the impact on any relevant legal (jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional) and social issues, as well as on the professionalism of the computing professionals involved. You should provide comparisons to the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct.<br><br>

            You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (including journals, books, and reports). This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth and your summary post is required in your e-portfolio.<br><br>

            Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long. Your initial post should be labelled 'initial post'."</i><br><br>

            Students were required to create an initial post and, then, address at least 3 of their peers' submissions before creating a summary post. This final entry would serve as an evolved version of a student's initial post, incorporating peer responses and directly addressing them by either agreeing or not and providing the reasons for either case. My initial post, "Death Machines - The Ethics of Autonomous Weapons", was as follows:<br><br>

            <h3 id="colab-11">Peer feedback</h3>
                <p>The peer responses from Stephanie Irina, Ali Alzahmi, and Fahad Abdallah, three of my peers, were instrumental in building upon my initial post. For Stephanie, her response was as follows.<br><br>

            <h3 id="colab-12">Summary post</h3>
                <p>My initial entry was significantly enhanced by my peers' feedback. Their comments were addressed by my summary post, which was as follows:<br><br>

        <h2 id="eportfolio2">e-Portfolio Activity: Research Proposal Review</h2>
            <p>The second e-portfolio activity consisted of the following:<br><br>

            <i>"Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project:<br>

            <ul>
                <li>Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?</li>
                <li>Which data collection methods would you consider using?</li>
                <li>Which required skills will you need to have or develop for the chosen project?</li>
            </ul>

            Note that you may find that you could be using a mixture of both the research methods and the data collection methods. These considerations will be included in your presentation of the Project Proposal in unit 10."</i><br><br>

            The method that would best suit my purpose with my research proposal is "cognitive task analysis", a psychological method which aims to explain the mental processes, such as decision-making, problem solving, attention and judgment, involved in processing a task (Sage, 2021). As for the data collection methods I'd consider using, they'd mostly revolve around psychometrics, which is defined by Sage (2021) as the application of mathematical principles to the measurement of psychological constructs. Finally, for the skills I'll need to have or develop for the chosen project, they'd mostly constituted by reinforcement learning, psychology, cognitive modelling, and computational neuroscience.<br><br>

        <h2 id="unit3-seminar-prep">Unit 3 Seminar Preparation</h2>
            <p>The third seminar preparation activity consisted of the following:<br><br>
            
            <i>"In preparation for this week’s seminar, you will need to source at least 2 papers in a Computing subject of your choice (AI, Cybersecurity, Data Science, or Computer Science), provided they utilise two different types of research methods. Now answer the following questions:<br>

            <ul> 
                <li>Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research question of each paper. Are they in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic, contributing to the collective body of knowledge in this area?</li> 
                <li>Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the stated purpose or question?</li> 
                <li>In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or question?</li> <li>Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?</li> 
                <li>How would you enhance the work/paper?</li> 
            </ul>
            
            Be prepared to discuss your findings in the seminar session."</i><br><br>

            For this activity, I selected two papers within the AI field that utilize different research methodologies: one empirical and one theoretical.<br><br>

            <strong>Paper 1:</strong> "Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models" by Jason Wei et al. (2022).<br><br>

            The purpose of this paper was to investigate whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit emergent capabilities not present in smaller models. The problem addressed is the unpredictability of model scaling, where qualitative leaps in performance ("emergence") occur. Their objective was to systematically analyse this phenomenon across various tasks. This aligns well with my experience in AI, particularly in observing how LLMs behave unpredictably at scale. It contributes significantly to understanding scaling laws and emergent behaviours.<br><br>

            The chosen methodology was empirical experimentation, which is highly appropriate given the need to benchmark LLM performance across scales. Data collection was done using standard benchmark datasets (e.g., MMLU, HumanEval), and analysis involved plotting performance against model size, making it suitable for the research aim.<br><br>

            The authors supported their claims with clear empirical evidence, performance graphs, and statistical analysis, making their conclusions well-founded. To enhance the paper, I would suggest expanding the task variety beyond QA and coding tasks, adding interpretability studies to explore the causes of emergent behaviour, and conducting cross-architecture comparisons.<br><br>

            <strong>Paper 2:</strong> "A Formal Definition of General Intelligence" by Shane Legg & Marcus Hutter (2007).<br><br>

            This paper aimed to provide a rigorous, mathematical definition of general intelligence, addressing the lack of a universal formalisation. Their objective was to define intelligence based on an agent's ability to achieve goals across diverse environments. This resonates with my interests in AI and cognitive science, offering a foundational contribution to the field.<br><br>

            The methodology was theoretical and analytical, relying on algorithmic information theory, Solomonoff induction, and Kolmogorov complexity. This approach was appropriate as the research problem required formalisation rather than empirical validation. Data collection was not applicable; instead, formal proofs and deductive reasoning formed the basis of analysis, which is fitting for the study's goals.<br><br>

            The paper's claims are thoroughly supported through logical arguments and mathematical derivations. To enhance this work, empirical approximations using modern AI agents could be explored to test the formal intelligence measures. Additionally, expanding the definition to include embodied and multi-modal intelligence in the context of modern AI developments would be valuable.<br><br>

        <h2 id="unit4-seminar-prep">Unit 4 Seminar Preparation</h2>
            <p>The fourth seminar preparation activity consisted of the following:<br><br>

            <i>"Please read the case below and answer the questions. You need to determine the ethical issues involved with this case.<br><br>

            <strong>The Case</strong><br><br>

            Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of some records.<br><br>

            Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study.<br><br>

            Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?

            <ul>
                <li>If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?</li>
                <li>Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?</li>
                <li>Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?</li>
                <li>Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?</li>
            </ul>
            
            Be prepared to discuss your answers during the seminar session."</i><br><br>

            Considering the topic and questions presented, here are the following issues with each option:<br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, he should not release the names and addresses. As this is not his responsibility, he should escalate Beth's request to his manager so that the right individual, and procedures, can be identified.</li>
                <li>Ricardo would need to be very careful with what kind of information he is going to grant Beth access to. He'd need to comply with local data laws and, as names and addresses are sensitive information, people whose information is granted to the researcher could have their privacy compromised.</li>
                <li>Beth should contact the individuals only if there is express authorisation for this. Suddenly reaching out to people who have no idea about her research could be seen very negatively, and even as a breach of privacy. Ultimately, the Records department should release individuals' names only if it's allowed by law and there is a clause that allows them to, which all individuals must consent to as well.</li>
                <li>Beth could try reaching out to other organisations to verify if they have similar records and, crucially, she has express authorisation to reach out to individuals in their records. In the worst case scenario, she would need to simplify her study with sampling methods given the viable population number would not be met.</li>

        <h2 id="eportfolio3">e-Portfolio Activity: Reflective Activity 2</h2>
            <p>The second e-portfolio reflective activity consisted of the following:<br><br>

            <i>"<strong>Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</strong><br><br>

            In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.<br><br>

            Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.<br><br>

            Record your findings in your e-Portfolio. You can also submit your findings to your tutor for formative feedback."</i><br><br>

            Considering the topic and questions presented, here are the key points:

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cambridge Analytica used deceptive surveys</strong> to harvest data from millions (Cadwalladr and Graham-Harrison, 2018). Participants were unaware of the full scope of data access, violating their privacy and informed consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Google’s Street View cars (2010)</strong> accidentally collected personal data from Wi-Fi networks, including emails and passwords (Kiss, 2010). Though unintended, it exposed gaps in data handling practices.</li>
                <li><strong>TikTok has also faced scrutiny</strong> for collecting behavioural data on minors through in-app surveys and engagement without adequate transparency or parental consent (Gerken, 2025), showcasing how user control may be bypassed entirely at a company's whim.</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Ethical, Legal, Social, and Professional Implications:</strong><br><br>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ethical:</strong> All examples demonstrate a lack of informed consent and respect for individual autonomy. Especially in TikTok’s case, child data protection is a major ethical concern.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal:</strong> These cases led to regulatory action, such as GDPR penalties in Europe and FTC investigations in the US. They highlight the importance of compliance with data protection laws.</li>
                <li><strong>Social:</strong> Public trust in tech platforms was significantly damaged. People became more cautious about sharing personal data online.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional:</strong> Developers and data scientists have a duty to uphold ethical standards like those from ACM and IEEE. These cases reveal a need for stronger accountability in digital research and product design.</li>
            </ul>
            
            The misuse of surveys for covert data collection shows how ethical lapses in design can lead to large-scale consequences. Transparency, consent, and lawful processing must be prioritised to protect individuals and maintain public trust.<br><br>

        <h2 id="reflective-piece1">Mid-Module Reflective Piece</h2>
            <p>Reaching the halfway point of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module, I’ve come to appreciate how ethical considerations are deeply woven into the fabric of modern computing, especially in the context of generative AI. Reflecting on global governance frameworks through texts like Corrêa et al. (2023) and Deckard (2023), I’ve gained a nuanced understanding of how different cultural and regulatory perspectives shape AI development. Engaging in collaborative discussions, such as the debate on autonomous weapons, further challenged me to reconcile innovation with responsibility, while peer feedback expanded my view on the broader implications of AI technologies.<br><br>

            In parallel, the portfolio activities and seminar preparations have helped solidify both my academic and practical grounding. Planning my literature review on language preservation and outlining my capstone project on dopamine-driven decision-making have allowed me to apply research methods to deeply personal and interdisciplinary areas of interest. Altogether, the module is shaping my development not just as a researcher, but as a more ethically aware and critically reflective computing professional.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="colab-2">Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h2>
            <p>The second collaborative learning discussion served as a way for students to deepen their understanding of ethics in research. We had the following topic to elaborate on:<br><br>
            
            "<i>Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.<br><br>

            Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz in a more favourable light. “After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support either side of any issue.”<br><br>

            <strong>Ethical Concerns</strong>

            <ul>
                <li>Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically. But is it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions?</li>
                <li>Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?</li>
                <li>Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?</li>
                <li>If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that they will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he?</li>
            </ul>

            You should also highlight legal, social and professional impacts of any choices made. Please note that there are no right or wrong answers here and you may introduce local, as well as international, legislature in your responses."</i><br><br>

            Students were required to create an initial post and, then, address at least 2 of their peers' submissions before creating a summary post. This final entry would serve as an evolved version of a student's initial post, incorporating peer responses and directly addressing them by either agreeing or not and providing the reasons for either case. My initial post, "Initial Post", was as follows.<br><br>

                <p>The peer responses from Kingsley Onyeemeosi and Ali Yousef Ebrahim Mohammed Alshehhi were instrumental in building upon my initial post. Kingsley's response was as follows:<br><br>

        <h2 id="summary-measures">Summary Measures</h2>
            <p>This section consisted of a series of exercises to be done in either Excel or LibreOffice. For exercise 8.1D, we had the following:<br><br>

            <center><img src="img/research_methods_and_prof_prac/exercise_8_1B.png" height="150" width="450"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 9: The results from the exercise 8.1B Excel sheet</font></center><br><br>

            From the results, it's clear that both diets were effective. However, it's possible to infer that diet A has proven more successful than diet B, given it has a larger average weight loss and smaller standard deviation.<br><br>

            For exercise 8.2B, we had the following:<br><br>

            <center><img src="img/research_methods_and_prof_prac/exercise_8_2B.png" height="300" width="450"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 10: The results from the exercise 8.2B Excel sheet</font></center><br><br>

            From the results, it's once more clear that both diets were effective. Diet A continues to have an edge, as it possesses larger median, first quartile and third quartile values.<br><br>

            For exercise 8.3D, we had the following:<br><br>

            <center><img src="img/research_methods_and_prof_prac/exercise_8_3D.png" height="500" width="350"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 11: The results from the exercise 8.3D Excel sheet</font></center><br><br>

            Out of the 90 respondends in Area 2, 21.1% preferred Brand A, 33.3% preferred Brand B, and the remaining 45.6% preferred some other brand of breakfast cereal. Thus, it can be argued that both Area A and B respondents tend to favour other breakfast cereal brands rather than Brands A or B.<br><br></p>


        <h2 id="hypothesis-testing">Hypothesis Testing</h2>
            <p>This section consisted of a series of exercises to be done in either Excel or LibreOffice. For exercise 8.4G, on the related samples T-test, we had the following:<br><br>

            <center><img src="img/research_methods_and_prof_prac/exercise_8_4G.png" height="350" width="450"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 12: The results from the exercise 8.4G Excel sheet</font></center><br><br>

            The sample mean numbers of impurity for Filter Agents 1 and 2 were, respectively, 8.25 and 8.683. The data reveals that there's significant evidence that the underlying mean impurity is greater for Filter Agent 2, by an estimated 8.683 - 8.25 = 0.433 units. The results, therefore, suggest that Filter Agent 1 should be preferred.<br><br>

            For exercise 8.6C, on the independent samples t-test, we have:<br><br>

            <center><img src="img/research_methods_and_prof_prac/exercise_8_6C.png" height="350" width="700"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 13: The results from the exercise 8.6C Excel sheet</font></center><br><br>

            The sample variances for male and female income are 233.129 and 190.176, respectively. The observed F-statistic is 1.226 with 59 and 59 degrees of freedom, yielding a two-tailed p-value of 0.436. This p-value exceeds the 0.05 significance level, so we do not reject the null hypothesis of equal variances. Therefore, and to validate such claims, we proceed with the equal variances form of the independent samples t-test.<br><br>

            A separate t-test yields a two-tailed p-value of 0.0014, which is significant at the 1% level. The sample mean income for males and females are, respectively, 52.913 and 44.233. The data therefore constitute strong evidence that the underlying mean income was greater for males, by an estimated 52.913 - 44.233 = 8.68 units. The results strongly suggest that the mean income for males exceeds that of females.</p><br><br>

        
        <h2 id="bar-charts-and-histograms">Bar Charts and Histograms</h2>
            <p>The subsequent exercises were focused on bar charts and histograms. For exercise 9.1D, we have:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/research_methods_and_prof_prac/exercise_9_1D.png" height="400" width="800"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 14: The results from the exercise 9.1D Excel sheet</font></center><br><br>
            
            It's clear from the chart that Brand A is the least preferred, followed by Brand B, whilst most respondents preferred some other brand.<br><br>

            For exercise 9.2D, we had the following:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/research_methods_and_prof_prac/exercise_9_2D.png" height="400" width="850"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 15: The results from the exercise 9.2D Excel sheet</font></center><br><br>

            It's clear from the chart that Brand A is the least preferred, followed by Brand B, whilst most respondents preferred some other brand. Interestingly, it's clear that respondents from Area 1 have a greater preference for Brand A and and other brands when compared to those from Area 2, while the opposite is observed for Brand B.<br><br>

            For exercise 9.3B, we had the following:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/research_methods_and_prof_prac/exercise_9_3B.png" height="350" width="1100"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 16: The results from the exercise 9.3B Excel sheet</font></center><br><br>

            For those individuals who underwent diet A, the weight loss distribution is unimodal and symmetrical, with perhaps a hint of negative skewness.</p>
