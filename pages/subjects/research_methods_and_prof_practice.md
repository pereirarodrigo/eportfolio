        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Taught by Karen Outram, the "Research Methods and Professional Practice" module covered essential research tools, such as the scientific method, data analysis, and academic writing, while also addressing legal, ethical, and professional issues in computing.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="reflective1">Reflective Activity 1: Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI</h2>
            <p>The first assignment was a reflective piece based on Corrêa et al. (2023) and Deckard (2023), addressing the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues of generative AI in the computing industry.<br><br>

            <strong>Evaluating AI Ethics and Governance in the Generative AI Era</strong><br><br>

            The rise of generative AI, exemplified by ChatGPT, Midjourney, and AlphaCode, has amplified global concerns around ethical, legal, and professional responsibilities. Corrêa et al. (2023), reviewing over 200 AI ethics guidelines, and Deckard (2023) highlight that while core principles like transparency, accountability, and fairness are widely endorsed, enforcement and cultural interpretation vary.<br><br>

            Five key principles, beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability, are echoed across frameworks such as the EU’s High-Level Expert Group on AI (European Commission, 2024), Japan’s Social Principles (Cabinet Secretariat, 2019), and Brazil’s PL 2338/2023 (UNESCO, N.D.). Yet, the EU’s push for binding laws contrasts with other regions' reliance on voluntary codes, creating regulatory gaps and ethical inconsistencies, particularly when AI systems cross borders.<br><br>

            Professionals must balance innovation with risks like misinformation and job loss. Deckard (2023) stresses that ethics should be ingrained in professional culture. While BCS (2024), ACM (2018), and IEEE (2023) advocate harm reduction and inclusivity, lasting change depends on embedding ethics into education, hiring, and practice, despite market pressures.<br><br>

            <strong>Recommended Course of Action</strong><br><br>
            
            Given this context, a multilayered governance approach is essential. I recommend the following actions:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mandatory Impact Assessments:</strong> organizations deploying generative AI should conduct assessments covering risks like bias, misuse, and labor impact, similar to GDPR requirements.<br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>AI ethics by design:</strong> ethics must be integrated early, using fairness metrics, interpretability tools, and human oversight from the start.<br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>International harmonisation with cultural sensitivity:</strong> shared AI principles should allow cultural adaptation, such as autonomy varying across societies, requiring flexible yet aligned frameworks.<br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Legal backstops for high-risk AI:</strong> harmful applications like deepfakes or surveillance must be strictly regulated, with liability shared by developers and deployers.<br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Public AI literacy and feedback channels:</strong> public understanding is vital. Education and feedback systems should target especially vulnerable communities.<br><br>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2 id="eportfolio1">e-Portfolio Activity: Literature Review and Research Proposal Outlines</h2>
            <p>The first e-portfolio activity involved outlining literature review and capstone project ideas. My review, titled "Uplifting Voices," explores how AI can support the preservation of minority languages in digital form, with feedback planned for unit 4.<br><br>

            My capstone project, "Simulating Risk-Based Decision-Making and Dopaminergic Dysfunctions," aims to model dopamine-related behaviours in gambling scenarios using hierarchical reinforcement learning. The outline will be submitted in unit 8.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="colab-1">Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
            <p>The first collaborative discussion introduced students to ethics and conduct in AI, requiring analysis of a case study from the ACM. My initial post, titled "Death Machines – The Ethics of Autonomous Weapons", was as follows:<br><br>

            <h3 id="colab-11">Peer feedback</h3>
                <p>The peer responses from Stephanie Irina, Ali Alzahmi, and Fahad Abdallah, three of my peers, were instrumental in building upon my initial post. For Stephanie, her response was as follows.<br><br>

                <font size="2">Figure 2: Ali's peer response to my initial post</font></center><br><br>

                Finally, for Fahad, his respose was as follows:<br><br>

            <h3 id="colab-12">Summary Post</h3>
                <p>My initial entry was significantly enhanced by my peers' feedback. Their comments were addressed by my summary post, which was as follows:<br><br>

        <h2 id="eportfolio2">e-Portfolio Activity: Research Proposal Review</h2>
            <p>The second e-portfolio activity involved explaining which research methods would support our final project. For my proposal, "cognitive task analysis" is the most suitable, as it examines mental processes like decision-making and judgment (Sage, 2021). I plan to use psychometric techniques for data collection, applying mathematical methods to measure psychological constructs. Key skills for the project include reinforcement learning, psychology, cognitive modelling, and computational neuroscience.</p><br><br>

        <h2 id="mid-module-reflection">Mid-Module Reflective Piece</h2>
            <p>This module has, so far, strengthened my understanding of the ethical, legal, and professional aspects of computing, especially around generative AI. The reflective activities and peer discussion highlighted the need for responsible innovation and culturally aware governance. Engaging with others broadened my perspective, while the e-portfolio tasks helped align my interests in cognitive modelling and AI ethics. I now see the importance of embedding ethics early in both research and development, and feel motivated for what's ahead.</p><br><br>

        
        <h2 id="literature-review-submission">Literature Review Submission</h2>
            <p>My literature review, titled "Artificial Intelligence in Language Preservation - A World of Careful Optimism and Empowerment", addressed the use of AI technologies in language preservation efforts, highlighting how natural language processing (NLP), in particular, has become increasingly prevalent in such endeavours.<br><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 6: The abstract section in my literature review</font></center><br><br>

            While overly ambitious at times, and deviating from the original outline after tutor feedback, this literature review managed to offer a grounded perspective of both the advantages and disadvantages of relying on this technology in a topic as sensitive as language preservation, with a particular emphasis on how proper data cleaning efforts are paramount for NLP models to work effectively.<br><br>

        <h2 id="colab-2">Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h2>
            <p>The second collaborative discussion centred on Abi, a researcher facing a potential ethical conflict driven by his employer’s corporate interests. My initial post, titled "Initial Post," was as follows:<br><br>

        <h2 id="summary-measures">Statistical Analysis 1 - Summary Measures</h2>
            <p>This section consisted of a series of exercises to be done in either Excel or LibreOffice. For exercise 8.1D, we had the following:<br><br>

            <center><img src="img/research_methods_and_prof_prac/exercise_8_1B.png" height="150" width="450"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 12: The results from the exercise 8.1B Excel sheet</font></center><br><br>

            From the results, it's clear that both diets were effective. However, it's possible to infer that diet A has proven more successful than diet B, given it has a larger average weight loss and smaller standard deviation.<br><br>

            For exercise 8.2B, we had the following:<br><br>

            <center><img src="img/research_methods_and_prof_prac/exercise_8_2B.png" height="300" width="450"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 13: The results from the exercise 8.2B Excel sheet</font></center><br><br>

            From the results, it's once more clear that both diets were effective. Diet A continues to have an edge, as it possesses larger median, first quartile and third quartile values.<br><br>

            For exercise 8.3D, we had the following:<br><br>

            <center><img src="img/research_methods_and_prof_prac/exercise_8_3D.png" height="500" width="350"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 14: The results from the exercise 8.3D Excel sheet</font></center><br><br>

            Among 90 respondents in Area 2, 21.1% preferred Brand A, 33.3% Brand B, and 45.6% other brands. This suggests that both Area A and B respondents generally favour other cereal brands over A or B.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="hypothesis-testing">Statistical Analysis 2 - Hypothesis Testing</h2>
            <p>This section consisted of a series of exercises to be done in either Excel or LibreOffice. For exercise 8.4G, we had:<br><br>

            Filter Agent 1 and 2 had mean impurity levels of 8.25 and 8.683, respectively. The 0.433-unit difference suggests significantly higher impurity for Agent 2, indicating that Filter Agent 1 is the preferable choice.<br><br>

            For exercise 8.6C, on the independent samples t-test, we have:<br><br>

            <center><img src="img/research_methods_and_prof_prac/exercise_8_6C.png" height="350" width="700"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 16: The results from the exercise 8.6C Excel sheet</font></center><br><br>

            The income variances for males and females are 233.129 and 190.176, respectively. An F-test yields a p-value of 0.436, exceeding the 0.05 threshold, so we assume equal variances. A subsequent t-test gives a significant p-value of 0.0014, indicating strong evidence that male mean income (52.913) exceeds female mean income (44.233) by approximately 8.68 units.</p><br><br>

        
        <h2 id="bar-charts-and-histograms">Statistical Analysis 3 - Bar Charts and Histograms</h2>
            <p>The subsequent exercises were focused on bar charts and histograms. For exercise 9.1D, we had:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/research_methods_and_prof_prac/exercise_9_1D.png" height="400" width="800"><br>

            It's clear from the chart that Brand A is the least preferred, followed by Brand B, whilst most respondents preferred some other brand.<br><br>

            For exercise 9.2D, we had the following:<br><br>
            
            <center><img src="img/research_methods_and_prof_prac/exercise_9_2D.png" height="400" width="850"><br>
                
            <font size="2">Figure 18: The results from the exercise 9.2D Excel sheet</font></center><br><br>

            The chart shows Brand A is least preferred, then Brand B, with most respondents favouring other brands. Area 1 respondents preferred Brand A and other brands more than those in Area 2, who showed higher preference for Brand B.<br><br>

            For exercise 9.3B, we had the following:<br><br>

            This proposal is ultimately envisioned as my MSc capstone project. However, there are no misconceptions regarding its extensive scope, which is why it'll be limited to a proof-of-concept. Overall, it is expected that this project will contribute to better dopamine modelling solutions, which could prove instrumental in helping diagnose and treat dysfunctions such as Parkinson's in a more proactive manner.<br><br>

        <h2 id="final-reflection">Reflective Piece</h2>
            <p>This module has provided a multifaceted and intellectually enriching experience, deepening my understanding of research methods, professional ethics, and statistical analysis. More than just content delivery, it has served as a framework for critical thinking and self-evaluation. As Rolfe et al. (2001) state, “critical reflection can only be mastered by doing it”, and this sentiment resonates strongly with my experience. Through continuous application, such as writing, reviewing, and receiving feedback, I have sharpened my reflective ability and come to recognise its centrality in both academic and professional practice.<br><br>

            <strong>Ethical Awareness and Generative AI</strong><br><br>

            My initial reflective activity, focusing on the ethics of generative AI, was one of the first true turning points in this journey. Exploring Corrêa et al. (2023) and Deckard (2023), I encountered how widespread ethical principles such as autonomy, beneficence, and explicability are interpreted differently across cultures and governance systems. The case of generative AI was not just hypothetical: it was immediate, relevant, and grounded in reality. Tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney are not confined to the lab, as they actively reshape industries, learning environments, and job markets.<br><br>

            Through this task, I recognised the tension between innovation and accountability. While organisations race to deploy powerful AI systems, ethical considerations often become secondary. This sparked a realisation: as a professional in computing, I carry the responsibility not only of technical rigour but of ethical foresight. The recommended actions I outlined, including mandatory impact assessments and culturally sensitive regulation, reflect this evolving awareness.<br><br>

            <strong>Peer Collaboration and Growth</strong><br><br>

            The collaborative learning discussions furthered this development by exposing me to new lenses of interpretation. Engaging with peers like Stephanie, Ali, Fahad, Kingsley, and Ali Yousef helped reinforce the idea that ethical dilemmas are rarely black and white. For example, in the “Death Machines” case on autonomous weapons, our exchanges highlighted the moral complexity behind military AI applications. Are autonomous weapons inherently unethical, or is the lack of human accountability the core issue? These discussions forced me to reassess my assumptions, improving both my articulation and listening skills.<br><br>

            What stood out most was how peer feedback consistently improved my outputs. Comments from others illuminated blind spots, often pushing me to refine or expand my arguments in ways I hadn’t initially considered. My summary posts, shaped by such feedback, illustrate how reflective learning isn't isolated introspection, but rather a collaborative act. Through this, I developed a stronger sense of academic humility, learning to value divergent views without losing my core reasoning.<br><br>

            <strong>Research Design and Conceptual Alignment</strong><br><br>

            The e-portfolio activities were particularly valuable in helping me align my academic passions with concrete research practice. My literature review, “Artificial Intelligence in Language Preservation – A World of Careful Optimism and Empowerment”, exemplifies this. It examined how NLP technologies can support the preservation of minority languages, especially those at risk of disappearing in the digital age. Tutor feedback initially pointed out overreach in scope, prompting me to refocus. This was a difficult but necessary lesson in research pragmatism: ambition must be tempered by feasibility. The final review struck a better balance, and I now understand the critical importance of scope definition and iterative review in any serious research process.<br><br>

            This insight carried into my research proposal on simulating dopamine-related decision-making using HRL. This project is complex by nature, bringing together neuroscience, psychology, and AI. Through this module, I began to understand the utility of methods like cognitive task analysis (Sage, 2021) and psychometrics in making such interdisciplinary ideas concrete. They provide a structured way to capture cognitive processes that would otherwise remain abstract or theoretical. The ability to translate high-level ideas into researchable hypotheses and measurable outcomes is one of the most valuable skills I have gained.<br><br>

            <strong>Real-World Ethics and Case-Based Reflection</strong><br><br>

            One of the most striking activities was the second reflective task, where I analysed the misuse of surveys in real-world scenarios. The Cambridge Analytica scandal, Google’s accidental data harvesting, and TikTok’s practices with minors all revealed how ethical lapses can originate not from malice, but from poor planning, hidden incentives, or lack of foresight. The recurring issue across these cases was consent, its absence, obfuscation, or violation. This led me to critically reconsider how data is collected in any of my future projects, especially in studies involving vulnerable populations.<br><br>

            More importantly, these cases underscored the concept that poor ethical design is not just a personal failure—it can have massive legal and social ramifications. By exploring GDPR violations and public backlash, I began to grasp the broader ecosystem in which developers, researchers, and users interact. Ethics is not a footnote or afterthought, but rather is infrastructure. The lesson here is clear: to be technically brilliant but ethically negligent is to build on sand.<br><br>

            <strong>Statistical Application and Analytical Confidence</strong><br><br>

            Another domain of notable development was statistical analysis. I had prior exposure to data science, but this module taught me to revisit fundamental principles with a more critical lens. Exercises such as t-tests, bar charts, histograms, and hypothesis testing weren’t just technical drills, as they forced me to articulate the meaning behind the numbers. For example, the F-test and t-test around income differences between males and females required me to consider not only statistical significance but social interpretation. What does it mean when a difference is statistically significant in such a context? Is it enough to report the p-value, or must we explore implications and biases in the dataset?<br><br>

            <strong>Personal Development and Forward Outlook</strong><br><br>

            Finally, reflecting on my own development throughout the module, I’ve noticed a shift not just in knowledge, but in identity. I am no longer simply a data scientist or programmer, as I am becoming a researcher and practitioner who views computation through an ethical, analytical, and human lens. Tools like the professional skills matrix and SWOT analysis helped formalise this reflection, making me consider not just what I know, but who I am becoming. My strengths, such as curiosity, interdisciplinary thinking, and ethical awareness, have become clearer. Likewise, areas like project scoping and survey design have emerged as growth areas.<br><br>

            In future projects, whether academic or industrial, I will bring with me this layered awareness: that technology does not exist in isolation, that ethics and governance are not abstract ideals but day-to-day responsibilities, and that reflection is not a one-time exercise, but a continuous act.<br><br>
