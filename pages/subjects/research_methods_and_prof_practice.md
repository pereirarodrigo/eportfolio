        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Taught by Karen Outram, the "Research Methods and Professional Practice" module covered essential research tools—such as the scientific method, data analysis, and academic writing—while also addressing legal, ethical, and professional issues in computing.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="reflective1">Reflective Activity 1: Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI</h2>
            <p>The first assignment was a reflective piece based on Corrêa et al. (2023) and Deckard (2023), addressing the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues of generative AI in the computing industry.<br><br>

            <strong>Evaluating AI Ethics and Governance in the Generative AI Era</strong><br><br>

            The rise of generative AI, exemplified by ChatGPT, Midjourney, and AlphaCode, has amplified global concerns around ethical, legal, and professional responsibilities. Corrêa et al. (2023), reviewing over 200 AI ethics guidelines, and Deckard (2023) highlight that while core principles like transparency, accountability, and fairness are widely endorsed, enforcement and cultural interpretation vary.<br><br>

            Five key principles, beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability, are echoed across frameworks such as the EU’s High-Level Expert Group on AI (European Commission, 2024), Japan’s Social Principles (Cabinet Secretariat, 2019), and Brazil’s PL 2338/2023 (UNESCO, N.D.). Yet, the EU’s push for binding laws contrasts with other regions' reliance on voluntary codes, creating regulatory gaps and ethical inconsistencies, particularly when AI systems cross borders.<br><br>

            Professionals must balance innovation with risks like misinformation and job loss. Deckard (2023) stresses that ethics should be ingrained in professional culture. While BCS (2024), ACM (2018), and IEEE (2023) advocate harm reduction and inclusivity, lasting change depends on embedding ethics into education, hiring, and practice, despite market pressures.<br><br>

            <strong>Recommended Course of Action</strong><br><br>
            
            Given this context, a multilayered governance approach is essential. I recommend the following actions:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mandatory Impact Assessments:</strong> organizations deploying generative AI should conduct assessments covering risks like bias, misuse, and labor impact, similar to GDPR requirements.<br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>AI ethics by design:</strong> ethics must be integrated early, using fairness metrics, interpretability tools, and human oversight from the start.<br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>International harmonisation with cultural sensitivity:</strong> shared AI principles should allow cultural adaptation, such as autonomy varying across societies, requiring flexible yet aligned frameworks.<br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Legal backstops for high-risk AI:</strong> harmful applications like deepfakes or surveillance must be strictly regulated, with liability shared by developers and deployers.<br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Public AI literacy and feedback channels:</strong> public understanding is vital. Education and feedback systems should target especially vulnerable communities.<br><br>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2 id="eportfolio1">e-Portfolio Activity: Literature Review and Research Proposal Outlines</h2>
            <p>The first e-portfolio activity involved outlining literature review and capstone project ideas. My review, titled "Uplifting Voices," explores how AI can support the preservation of minority languages in digital form, with feedback planned for unit 4.<br><br>

            My capstone project, "Simulating Risk-Based Decision-Making and Dopaminergic Dysfunctions," aims to model dopamine-related behaviours in gambling scenarios using hierarchical reinforcement learning. The outline will be submitted in unit 8.</p><br><br>


        <h2 id="colab-1">Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
            <p>The first collaborative discussion introduced students to ethics and conduct in AI, requiring analysis of a case study from the ACM. My initial post, titled "Death Machines – The Ethics of Autonomous Weapons", was as follows:<br><br>

            <h3 id="colab-11">Peer feedback</h3>
                <p>The peer responses from Stephanie Irina, Ali Alzahmi, and Fahad Abdallah, three of my peers, were instrumental in building upon my initial post. For Stephanie, her response was as follows.<br><br>

        <h2 id="eportfolio2">e-Portfolio Activity: Research Proposal Review</h2>
            <p>The second e-portfolio activity involved explaining which research methods would support our final project. For my proposal, "cognitive task analysis" is the most suitable, as it examines mental processes like decision-making and judgment (Sage, 2021). I plan to use psychometric techniques for data collection, applying mathematical methods to measure psychological constructs. Key skills for the project include reinforcement learning, psychology, cognitive modelling, and computational neuroscience.</p><br><br>

        <h2 id="unit3-seminar-prep">Unit 3 Seminar Preparation</h2>
            <p>The third seminar task involved selecting and critiquing two AI papers using different methodologies: one empirical, one theoretical. <br><br>

            <strong>Paper 1:</strong> "Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models" by Jason Wei et al. (2022).<br><br>

            This paper investigates whether LLMs exhibit emergent behaviours not seen in smaller models, highlighting the unpredictability of scaling. Using benchmarks like MMLU and HumanEval, the authors empirically demonstrated performance jumps with larger models. To enhance the work, I suggest broader task variety, interpretability analysis, and architectural comparisons.<br><br>

            <strong>Paper 2:</strong> "A Formal Definition of General Intelligence" by Shane Legg & Marcus Hutter (2007).<br><br>

            This theoretical paper defines intelligence as the ability to achieve goals across environments, using algorithmic information theory, Solomonoff induction, and Kolmogorov complexity. It provides a rigorous formalisation, though testing it on modern AI and expanding it to embodied, multi-modal contexts would add value.<br><br>

        <h2 id="unit4-seminar-prep">Unit 4 Seminar Preparation</h2>
            <p>The fourth seminar preparation activity consisted of addressing the ethical risks of Ricardo, a clerk, allowing Beth, a researcher, unrestricted access to potentially sensitive data. Considering the topic and questions presented, here are the following issues with each option:<br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>If Ricardo isn’t authorized to grant access, he should escalate Beth’s request to the appropriate authority.</li>
                <li>If he is responsible, Ricardo must comply with data laws, as releasing names and addresses could breach privacy.</li>
                <li>Beth should only contact individuals if legally authorized and consent has been obtained; otherwise, it risks violating privacy.</li>
                <li>If too few participants give consent, Beth could seek other data sources or adjust her study using sampling methods.</li>
            </ul></p><br><br>

        
        <h2 id="eportfolio3">e-Portfolio Activity: Reflective Activity 2</h2>
            <p>The second e-portfolio activity involved analysing a case study on the misuse of surveys. Key examples include:<br><br>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cambridge Analytica</strong> misused surveys to harvest data without proper consent (Cadwalladr and Graham-Harrison, 2018).</li>
                <li><strong>Google’s Street View cars (2010)</strong> unintentionally collected personal Wi-Fi data, exposing privacy flaws (Kiss, 2010).</li>
                <li><strong>TikTok</strong> collected behavioural data on minors without adequate transparency or consent (Gerken, 2025).</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Implications:</strong><br><br>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ethical:</strong> All cases reflect consent violations, especially concerning minors in TikTok’s case.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal:</strong> Triggered penalties under GDPR and FTC investigations, stressing the need for compliance.</li>
                <li><strong>Social:</strong> Public trust declined, with increased caution over data sharing.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional:</strong> Highlights the need for ethical responsibility among developers, aligned with ACM and IEEE codes.</li>
            </ul>

            Misusing surveys for hidden data collection reveals how ethical failures in design can have major consequences. Transparency and consent must be central to responsible digital practice.<br><br>

        <h2 id="summary-measures">Summary Measures</h2>
            <p>This section consisted of a series of exercises to be done in either Excel or LibreOffice. For exercise 8.1D, we had the following:<br><br>

            <font size="2">Figure 9: The results from the exercise 8.1B Excel sheet</font></center><br><br>

            From the results, it's clear that both diets were effective. However, it's possible to infer that diet A has proven more successful than diet B, given it has a larger average weight loss and smaller standard deviation.<br><br>

            For exercise 8.2B, we had the following:<br><br>

            <center><img src="img/research_methods_and_prof_prac/exercise_8_2B.png" height="300" width="450"><br>

            From the results, it's once more clear that both diets were effective. Diet A continues to have an edge, as it possesses larger median, first quartile and third quartile values.<br><br>

            For exercise 8.3D, we had the following:<br><br>

            Among 90 respondents in Area 2, 21.1% preferred Brand A, 33.3% Brand B, and 45.6% other brands. This suggests that both Area A and B respondents generally favour other cereal brands over A or B.</p><br><br>

            Filter Agent 1 and 2 had mean impurity levels of 8.25 and 8.683, respectively. The 0.433-unit difference suggests significantly higher impurity for Agent 2, indicating that Filter Agent 1 is the preferable choice.<br><br>

            For exercise 8.6C, on the independent samples t-test, we have:<br><br>

            The income variances for males and females are 233.129 and 190.176, respectively. An F-test yields a p-value of 0.436, exceeding the 0.05 threshold, so we assume equal variances. A subsequent t-test gives a significant p-value of 0.0014, indicating strong evidence that male mean income (52.913) exceeds female mean income (44.233) by approximately 8.68 units.</p><br><br>

        
        <h2 id="bar-charts-and-histograms">Bar Charts and Histograms</h2>
